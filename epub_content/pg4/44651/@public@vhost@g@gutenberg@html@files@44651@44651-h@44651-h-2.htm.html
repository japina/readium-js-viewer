<span class="s08">THE PRISONERS.</span></h2>
<p>Giving no heed to those around us, we continued on when the command was halted, much as if we had not heard the orders, and without anything in the way of leave-taking.</p>
<p>I know not how it may have been with my companions; but as for myself, I was in no mood to speak even with my uncle, so thickly did the sad and gloomy thoughts flow through my mind. It was to me as if we were playing the last acts in that drama which should have had a glorious ending—as if we were assisting at the death of the Cause, and I believe that nine out of every ten men in the brigade had some such thought as myself.</p>
<p>It was true that we might strike a blow at Nelson's Ferry, but let the reader remember <a id="Page_121" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[121]"></a> that ours was probably the only armed force, true to the colonies, then in the Carolinas; let him remember that the Britishers overran our land, even as did the locusts of old, and how might four hundred men or less oppose all the soldiers the king could send against us?</p>
<p>Surely for us of the southern colonies, this night, when we three set out to spy upon the victorious troops coming down from Camden with our friends as prisoners, was the worst ever known.</p>
<p>We were beaten—hemmed in, and, like rats in the corner, could only make one desperate fight, not against death, but simply as proof that our courage held good even to the very last moment.</p>
<p>Let all these things be borne well in mind, and it is little wonder that when we rode on after the command was halted, we were in no mood for leave-taking. Ours might, and it seemed probable it would, be the last blow in a gallant struggle for liberty. <a id="Page_122" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[122]"></a></p>
<p>When we passed the group of officers at the head of the column, all sitting their horses motionless as statues, looking neither to the right nor the left, but each man as it were peering into the recesses of his own heart, asking himself in what way the end would come, I gave one glance toward my uncle, and it seemed to me as if there was a certain uplifting of the eyebrows which I interpreted as a "good-by."</p>
<p>More than that we saw not, and five minutes later the brigade of Williamsburg patriots, tried and true, were left behind, while we two lads and the old man rode forward, hoping almost against hope that it might be possible we should accomplish something toward showing the British king how strong in our hearts was the desire for liberty.</p>
<p>Our horses, jaded by the long march of the day, were unwilling to leave the troop; they went forward listlessly, and we had not the heart to spur them on because it <a id="Page_123" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[123]"></a> was much as if they shared our feelings.</p>
<p>I question if we gained ten miles in advance of the column that night.</p>
<p>Certain it is we were not yet come within the vicinity of Nelson's Ferry when Gavin Witherspoon's horse stopped short, and the old man said as he dismounted slowly:</p>
<p>"We may as well rest here for the night, as a mile or two further on. I propose that we halt until a couple of hours before sunrise, and by so doing we shall gain time."</p>
<p>After the experience we had had with the old man, Percy and I were more than willing to follow his advice, and we set about making ourselves as comfortable as might be under all the circumstances.</p>
<p>A better place for camping could not be found. A tiny brook running through a grove of pines, where the underbrush was so dense as to form ample hiding-place, as well as a shelter from the dews of the night. There was little green feed for the <a id="Page_124" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[124]"></a> horses; but we carried a goodly store of grain on our saddles, and, heedless of the possible necessities of the future which seemed so dark, we allowed the tired steeds to eat their pleasure from the store.</p>
<p>Such food as we had, and as I have said was taken from the Tory camp, we ate, and then, lame and sore in every joint from the long hours in the saddle, we laid ourselves down for perchance the last sleep on this earth.</p>
<p>My eyes were closed in slumber within two or three minutes after I was thus stretched at full length upon the bed of pine needles, and it seemed as if I had slept several hours when something—I know not what—awakened me.</p>
<p>There was no movement, and the faint light of the stars did not penetrate the thicket; yet I could see that the horses were lying down; that my comrades were wrapped in slumber, and it puzzled me to make out why I was thus wakeful.</p>
<p>Then, partially turning my head, for no <a id="Page_125" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[125]"></a> other reason than to make a change of position, I saw what appeared to be the reflection of a camp-fire through the underbrush.</p>
<p>When one knows that he is surrounded by enemies, the lightest thing out of the ordinary arouses his suspicions, and although this gleam of light was so faint that at another time I would have given no heed to it, now it seemed absolutely necessary I should understand the cause.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to awaken my comrades, so I argued, when there might be no good reason, and I crept out through the bushes softly until, having traversed a distance of fifty yards or more, when I saw that we were not the only ones who had utilized this thicket as a camp.</p>
<p>Four men sat around a small fire eating, and near by were tethered their horses.</p>
<p>It was fortunate our steeds were so leg-weary, else when this party drove up they might have given the alarm, for I doubted not but that these were enemies. At such <a id="Page_126" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[126]"></a> time in the history of the so-called rebellion we had so few friends as to be able to say with a certainty where they were.</p>
<p>It was in my mind to return at once and arouse Gavin Witherspoon and Percy, that we might make our escape; but all was so quiet, and these four apparently unsuspicious that any save themselves were in the vicinity, that I delayed carrying out the purpose in my mind, until, having almost unconsciously approached a few yards nearer, I recognized in one of them, that Tory villain, Sam Lee.</p>
<p>Once this discovery was made I no longer thought of returning to where I had left my comrades; but wriggled along yet nearer, and was well repaid for the delay.</p>
<p>It would seem as if the men had been questioning young Lee as to his ability to do something which had been promised, for one of them was saying when I came within earshot:</p>
<p>"It is a blind chase to push ahead in search of a party of rebels who by this <a id="Page_127" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[127]"></a> time may have returned home, hoping to keep secret the part they have been playing."</p>
<p>To this Sam Lee replied hotly, much as if the honor of the James family were in his keeping:</p>
<p>"The major will never go home alive so long as one other can be found to remain with him, and there are many of his kin in Williamsburg."</p>
<p>"But what reason have we for believing you can lead us to them?"</p>
<p>"Because I know of their haunts," the scoundrel said, as if he was telling the truth. "So far all they have accomplished has been by surprising our people who are not soldiers; but I guarantee that you men of the Prince of Wales' regiment will make a different showing among them."</p>
<p>"Of that I have no question; but these people, knowing fully the country, can easily disperse between the time we come upon them, and word has been sent to the command. Then again, we must trust to <a id="Page_128" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[128]"></a> your finding them, which I misdoubt greatly, else are you a keener lad than I have seen in the Carolinas."</p>
<p>It was the eldest of the three men who said this, and as he moved slightly I saw that his uniform, which I knew full well, was that of the Prince of Wales' regiment, to which organization Sam Lee had referred.</p>
<p>"You may do as you please," the young Troy said angrily. "I have told the colonel that I could lead you to where the scarecrow Marion was encamped and put you on their trail wheresoever the forces might be going; but if, now that we are hardly more than started, you choose to turn back, it is none of my affair, I have done my part."</p>
<p>No reply was made to this, and for a time the men were silent, while I, speculating as to what might be their purpose, believed it was a simple matter to guess why they were there.</p>
<p>We knew full well that Sam Lee had been <a id="Page_129" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[129]"></a> in Captain Barfield's encampment, and, like the coward that he was, fled when our troops came up. He also must have ridden all day in order to gain Nelson's Ferry; had most likely met this regiment of the king's, and claimed ability to deliver our people into their hands. It seemed also true that these troopers had ridden in advance of the command, as had we three, and we were thus come together at a place midway between the Britishers and our own force.</p>
<p>Up to this point I had no difficulty in forming a satisfactory conclusion; but beyond that I was all at sea, and naturally thought the proper course was to return and give information to Gavin Witherspoon.</p>
<p>In fact I was in the act of turning when one of the soldiers said grumblingly:</p>
<p>"Even though the rebels may be where this lad has stated, I fail to see why we should have left the camp and ridden half a dozen miles in advance. What good can be gained by spending the night here, <a id="Page_130" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[130]"></a> when we might have done so with our comrades?"</p>
<p>"For my part," the third trooper added, "I would rather sleep here than do my share of guarding an hundred or more scurvy rebels. Had we stayed in camp some portion of the duty would have come upon us, whereas we may lie down under these bushes and sleep until it pleases us to open our eyes next morning."</p>
<p>"That is all very true," the first speaker replied; "yet there were good quarters to be found at Nelson's Ferry, and here a bed upon the ground is the best to be had."</p>
<p>It was almost with difficulty that I suppressed a cry of triumph, for now I had the full story, and we might return with the information desired by General Marion before having fairly set out to do the work.</p>
<p>The British force, comprised in whole or in part of the Prince of Wales' regiment, and guarding an hundred or more of our people, captured when General Gates was <a id="Page_131" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[131]"></a> defeated, were encamped at Nelson's Ferry, six or seven miles away. These fellows, through information given by Sam Lee, were coming out in search of us, and would not leave their halting-place until sunrise.</p>
<p>It was a lucky chance which led us to this spot, and the forebodings which had weighed heavily upon me a few hours previous, were lightened wonderfully by the thought that fortune, which had borne so hardly upon us in the past, was about taking a turn in our favor.</p>
<p>I lost no time in returning at once to my comrades, although forced to do so slowly lest I make so much of noise that the Tory and his red-coated companions be warned of our nearness.</p>
<p>Then, having arrived by the side of Percy and Gavin Witherspoon, I pressed both hands upon their mouths to prevent any cry in their awakening.</p>
<p>The old man's grasp upon my arm told that he was fully alive to the situation, <a id="Page_132" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[132]"></a> and I repeated as quickly as might be all that had been heard.</p>
<p>Sitting bolt upright as if any future movement depended wholly upon me, he said in a whisper:</p>
<p>"Whether the horses can cover sixteen or twenty miles after a long day's work, is a question."</p>
<p>"But one which you should not ask," Percy added in a more serious tone than I had ever heard him employ. "We have gained the information for which we were sent, and it must be carried back to camp without delay."</p>
<p>"I grant you that, lad; but was only asking myself whether it might be possible for our people to take advantage of it."</p>
<p>"Such speculations can be deferred until we have spoken with General Marion," Percy replied as he arose, and after that there was no discussion among us.</p>
<p>To get the horses on their feet without making a noise was no slight task; but <a id="Page_133" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[133]"></a> we accomplished it after a certain fashion, and led them out of the thicket, not mounting until we were fully two miles away.</p>
<p>After that our progress was no more rapid than if we had remained on foot, for it seemed impossible to urge the animals at a pace faster than a walk, and it appeared to me as if the morning must be near at hand when we were finally come to the encampment.</p>
<p>All our men were not given over to slumber, as was shown by our being challenged before yet we knew how near to us was the military force, and five minutes later we were standing beside our uncle, who, suddenly aroused from his sleep, asked with a note of alarm in his tones:</p>
<p>"What disaster has befallen you?"</p>
<p>We soon gave him to understand that fortune had played us a good turn, and immediately the information was given he became animated.</p>
<p>One would have said he had never known <a id="Page_134" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[134]"></a> fatigue, to have seen him as he ran toward where General Marion was sleeping, and, shaking the officer into wakefulness, he repeated in a few words our story.</p>
<p>I had supposed the news we brought would cause some sensation in the camp; but never believed it would be acted upon so quickly.</p>
<p>Within fifteen minutes from the time of our being challenged by the sentinel, every man was in the saddle, and Percy, Gavin Witherspoon and myself were riding at the head of the column by my uncle's side, in order that we might point out the place where the soldiers and Sam Lee were encamped.</p>
<p>We now learned that it was midnight; the tired men and their horses had had six hours of rest, and although the advance was not rapid, we pressed forward with greater speed than I had believed possible, our own steeds seeming to be revived by the companionship of the others.</p>
<p>Now I am come to that point in this <a id="Page_135" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[135]"></a> story concerning which I can say but little of my own knowledge, for certain it is that I fell asleep even while in the saddle, and was not conscious of anything until the halting of my horse nearly threw me over his head.</p>
<p>We had arrived within two miles of Nelson's Ferry, and it was yet night. Unless some unfortunate accident occurred at the last moment, there was an opportunity of our soon learning whether the British regulars would hold firm under such a surprise as we should be able to give them.</p>
<p>The purpose of the halt was not to reconnoiter, as I had at first supposed, but in order that a squad of twenty might be detached to gain possession of the road in the swamp at that post known as Horse Creek, while we were to attack the main body in the rear.</p>
<p>The scouts who had been sent ahead half an hour before my awakening, came back reporting that the enemy were encamped <a id="Page_136" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[136]"></a> on the east bank of the creek, which was another and a great point in our favor.</p>
<p>Once more would General Marion have a chance to execute his favorite maneuver, the only one by which we could hope to win while the odds were so heavily against us.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes or more were spent here waiting for the detachment to get into position at Horse Creek, and then the advance was resumed, this time at a slow pace lest the thud of our horses' feet upon the road should give an alarm.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I knew full well we would soon be engaged in deadly encounter, slumber weighed heavily upon my eyelids, and it was with difficulty I could prevent them from closing.</p>
<p>Rather like one in a dream, than a lad who burned to give his life for the Cause, did I hold myself in the saddle, and it seemed as if no more than ten minutes had passed when we were halted again, <a id="Page_137" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[137]"></a> this time so near the enemy that the gleam of his camp-fires could be seen.</p>
<p>The moment for reflection had come.</p>
<p>General Marion's force was about to be hurled upon the best men in the king's army. We who knew little or nothing of military tactics, we who were mounted upon jaded steeds, and half dead for lack of sleep, were about to charge a camp of well armed men, most likely in the best possible condition, and if the end for us of the southern colonies was near, it seemed as if this was indeed the last moment.</p>
<p>"At full speed, and do not fire until we are close upon them!" was the whispered word passed from man to man, and I saw those either side of me carefully charging their rifles or muskets.</p>
<p>Even though we were come upon the Prince of Wales' regiment and a portion of the 63d Regulars, as was afterward learned, the result was much the same as when we rode down upon the undisciplined Tories. <a id="Page_138" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[138]"></a></p>
<p>There was the onward leaping of the horses as the spurs were sunk deep in their flanks; the thunder of their hoofs; the cries of the enemy as they were awakened from their slumbers; our shouts of triumph; the crackle of musketry and the groans of the wounded.</p>
<p>It was a dream—a horrible nightmare rather than a reality, and had I been a spectator instead of a participant, it would have seemed no different.</p>
<p>At such times the excitement of the battle is full upon one, and I have yet to see man or boy who can give a clear and detailed account of all that occurred while the scent of the powder was in his nostrils.</p>
<p>This much I do know, that, as twice before, I loaded and discharged my musket, or used it as a club; that I forced my horse to keep pace with my uncle's steed, who was ever foremost in the fray, and then the fleeing mass told that the enemy were in retreat. <a id="Page_139" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[139]"></a></p>
<p>This victory, when the majority of our men had believed the attack would prove our final ending, did more to revive the drooping spirits of General Marion's force than anything else could have done.</p>
<p>We forgot weariness; forgot everything save the fact that we of Williamsburg had been pitted against the king's best soldiers, and were come out of the battle as well as when we met Major Gainey's or Barfield's men.</p>
<p>On this occasion, however, we did not press the pursuit. It was known that these soldiers would re-form, where raw recruits might continue panic-stricken, and we were not so strong in numbers as to risk a regular engagement.</p>
<p>My uncle was the foremost here, as he ever had been, and Percy and I remained by his side, therefore can I say of a verity that we did not ride after the retreating column more than half a mile; but, once well clear of the encampment, drew rein and turned about. <a id="Page_140" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[140]"></a></p>
<p>It was now near to daylight, and we soon learned that we had captured or killed twenty-two regulars, among whom was a captain, and held two Tories as prisoners.</p>
<p>Our loss was one killed and one wounded.</p>
<p>In addition to having thus gained a victory over the best of his majesty's soldiers in the colonies, we had recaptured one hundred and fifty men, and it is not necessary to say how much of rejoicing there was in our lines when the sun rose.</p>
<p>Now am I come to the shameful part of the story, and one which will be most difficult of belief.</p>
<p>To Percy and I it seemed that with this successful attack, by liberating one hundred and fifty men who were supposed to be friends to the Cause, because of wearing the Continental uniform, we had added just so much to General Marion's strength, and neither of us had any question but that every one of them would gladly join our force. <a id="Page_141" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[141]"></a></p>
<p>As we two believed, so did all our comrades as well as the officers who led us, for after the first rejoicings were over those who had been prisoners were ordered into line, and Major James proposed, with the air of one who thinks he makes what will be accepted without question, that they enroll themselves among us of Williamsburg until such time as we could fight our way through the district to where others who loved the Cause might be found.</p>
<p>To the shame of these Continental soldiers it must be set down that out of that number freed by us at risk of our lives, only three consented to serve under the general.</p>
<p>Some said that the "Cause was lost;" others declared that to fight longer was "simply to risk one's life without an object, because the king's troops overrun the country, and after the defeat of Gates there was no longer the slightest chance we could hold our own many days."</p>
<p>When no more than these three stepped forward from the ranks in response to his <a id="Page_142" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[142]"></a> proposal, and the others talked loudly among themselves, or with our men, my uncle turned away like one who is stricken with a deadly wound.</p>
<p>Then Percy and I made our way among these men who wore the buff and the blue, to hear further reasons as to why they had acted such a cowardly part.</p>
<p>It was a captain, one who should have been the first to urge his men to enlist, who said in reply to my questions:</p>
<p>"Surely the Cause has none in the Carolinas, save this beggarly force to which you are attached, while the British have overrun this section of the country. The Continentals are dispersed or captured; the Virginia and North Carolina militia are scattered to the four winds; Sumter's Legion has been whipped by Tarleton, and their leader is fleeing for his life. In addition to all that, here is a copy of the letter which Lord Clinton has sent to the commandants of the different posts throughout the colonies." <a id="Page_143" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[143]"></a></p>
<p>Then the officer handed me a slip of paper on which was written the following:</p>
<p>"I have given orders that all of the inhabitants of this province who have subscribed, and have taken part in this revolt, should be punished with the greatest rigor; and also those who will not turn out, that they may be imprisoned and their whole property taken from them or destroyed.... I have ordered in the most positive manner that every militiaman, who has borne arms with us, and afterwards joined the enemy, shall be immediately hanged!" <a id="Page_144" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[144]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00009">CHAPTER VII.<br/>
<span class="s08">THE RETREAT.</span></h2>
<p>We of Williamsburg were most certainly in a peculiar position, after having released one hundred and fifty prisoners and discovered that only three had sufficient faith in the Cause, or were sufficiently eager for death, to join us.</p>
<p>Now right here let me set down that the men under General Marion were true patriots, gentlemen of the Williamsburg district, and in every sense of the word, worthy citizens. This I say because the British people even at this late day, five years since peace was declared and we have become a free and independent people, say that "that officer who caused Tarleton so much annoyance had as a following only the dissolute and depraved." <a id="Page_145" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[145]"></a></p>
<p>I repeat, the force under General Marion was made up of gentlemen, the greater number of whom owned plantations in or near the Williamsburg district, and the fact that they had for a leader such a man as my uncle, Major James, is sufficient proof as to their character.</p>
<p>Although these men were by this time come to believe that the Cause for which they had struggled so long was much the same as lost, so far as we in the southern colonies were concerned, yet they were not of the class that acknowledges itself beaten while life remains.</p>
<p>Therefore it was, that instead of being yet further disheartened by this failure which followed a brilliant victory, they were the more determined to strike every possible blow before the end should come.</p>
<p>The cruel and barbarous proclamation of Lord Clinton aroused their anger rather than fear, and within half an hour after it had been circulated among us, I heard my uncle, the major, say that no document <a id="Page_146" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[146]"></a> could have been put in a style better calculated to drive recruits into our ranks than that which was written evidently for the purpose of frightening the colony into submission.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, a good word to be spoken for those men, who, having been released from captivity by us, were willing to serve under General Marion.</p>
<p>They had been whipped at the very moment victory seemed certain, and it is little wonder that the faint-hearted should have begun to despair, when, after four years of desperate struggling, the "rebellion" was well-nigh crushed out.</p>
<p>At the moment, we of Williamsburg could have no sympathy for such cowards, as we called them, and had any of the men begged us for food I question if we would have supplied their wants, so angered were we by the refusal to enlist.</p>
<p>It was evident to every man among us that it was not safe to remain on this road over which the British soldiers were continually <a id="Page_147" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[147]"></a> passing, and particularly since those whom we had defeated would speedily give information to all the king's officers in the colony.</p>
<p>From this hour our little brigade would be hunted down without mercy, and there could be no question but that the chase would be a lively one since the Britishers in this section had no other "rebels" with whom to occupy their attention.</p>
<p>Therefore it was that every man in the command felt a certain sense of relief, when, after a halt of no more than four hours, word was given to remount the tired horses.</p>
<p>We rode four hours or more, and then were come to the forest round about Hope Mountain, when the word was given that we would have an opportunity to indulge in a long rest.</p>
<p>During this march it can well be imagined that Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself kept a sharp lookout for Sam Lee. The greatest desire in my heart at that moment <a id="Page_148" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[148]"></a> was to make a prisoner of the young Tory, for he, knowing well every man in the brigade, would be able to give the Britishers many valuable hints regarding our probable whereabouts, and so long as he remained at liberty we had a dangerous enemy afoot, even though that enemy was a coward.</p>
<p>Every man, including officers, brought away with him from this last encounter a goodly store of provisions, and there was no fear of suffering from lack of food, even though we remained a week in this encampment at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The days were passed in perfect idleness, save so far as the grooming of our horses was concerned, and, although not a trooper left the camp, we were kept well informed regarding the movements of the enemy, by such of the people round about as were friendly to the Cause.</p>
<p>Therefore it was that we heard sad news from Camden when the humane and chivalrous Lord Cornwallis hanged eight old <a id="Page_149" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[149]"></a> men and seven boys, prisoners whom he had taken after the battle, simply because there was a suspicion that they might have been concerned in the so-called rebellion.</p>
<p>Nor was this wholesale murder the only crime committed by the conquerors in the Carolinas during the week we remained idle.</p>
<p>From every quarter came stories of barbarity and excesses committed by British officers, and that which seemed like a great misfortune soon proved, despite the horror, to be a blessing in disguise, for it drove into our ranks every man from the surrounding country who had ever been charged, whether rightfully or no, with taking any part whatsoever in the resistance to the king's oppressions.</p>
<p>Within six days there were enrolled among the followers of General Marion no less than seven hundred and fifty good men and true; but it is not to be supposed that such number remained in camp. <a id="Page_150" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[150]"></a></p>
<p>In fact, although the brigade was being strengthened daily, the force under arms was decreasing, and for two good reasons: First, because such a body could not readily be supplied with provisions, and secondly, because the majority of these troopers were men of families, who, during this season of inactivity, took advantage of the opportunity to provide for the wants of those at home.</p>
<p>No more than one hundred and fifty remained in the camp at Hope Mountain; but the others stood ready to respond to the first summons that their service was needed.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening of the eighth day, when one on whose fidelity to the Cause we could rely, came into camp with the information that Tarleton's Legion and a strong force under Major Wemyss, had been sent by Lord Cornwallis against us.</p>
<p>Although his lordship had affected to despise General Marion, he certainly acted as if he believed our commander a gallant <a id="Page_151" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[151]"></a> officer, otherwise why were the 63d Regulars and the Legion of Tarleton sent against what the Britishers had contemptuously termed "that beggarly crew."</p>
<p>Before morning other friends came into camp, and we knew that the two forces were not as yet united; but Major Wemyss with the 63d Regulars, and a large body of Tories under Major Harrison, were advancing rapidly toward Hope Mountain, information of our whereabouts having been given, perhaps, by that young scoundrel, Sam Lee, who I doubted not was doing his best to work us harm.</p>
<p>Although there was much in this information to dishearten, I believe every member of our small band felt a certain sense of satisfaction that the time for action was near at hand. None of us had doubted but that we should be employed against the enemy in some manner, despite the great difference in numbers.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and I were so fortunate as to be among the fifty selected <a id="Page_152" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[152]"></a> to reconnoiter, and when we saddled our horses, which were in prime condition after their long halt, there was a certain sense of exultation in our hearts, even though it seemed absolutely certain we could effect nothing so far as the welfare of the Cause was concerned.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose to write at any length regarding the adventure which befell us, for among the many deeds of daring which the followers of General Marion were given liberty to perform, this incident would seem to one who did not take part in it, as something too trifling to be worthy of mention.</p>
<p>Therefore will I tell it hurriedly, and in the fewest words, in order the sooner to come to that time of sorrow and humiliation when we began the retreat from the lower Carolinas.</p>
<p>We, fifty picked men, and I speak of Percy and myself as such although we were only boys, set out near to noon on the reconnoiter, understanding that the remainder <a id="Page_153" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[153]"></a> of the force led by General Marion would follow fifteen or twenty miles in the rear in order to be ready, if opportunity presented itself, to fall upon the detached bands of Major Wemyss' command.</p>
<p>It was known, however, that the general would halt at the old Sinclair plantation, if it so chanced that the venture should lead us thus far.</p>
<p>Until nightfall we rode straight on, and then we were met by those who told us that the advance guard of the enemy was near at hand.</p>
<p>The command was immediately given for each man to conceal himself in the thicket either side the road, where a view could be had of the enemy as they passed, and in such position we were to remain until the last straggler was beyond us, after which the major proposed that, by making a wide detour, we could reach the Sinclair plantation in ample time to give an alarm, should it be learned that the attack was not advisable. <a id="Page_154" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[154]"></a></p>
<p>Although we were in hiding, and there was little reason for whosoever might lead this force to believe any of Marion's men were in the vicinity, the position we had taken was a dangerous one, for peradventure one of our horses was allowed to whinny, the Britishers would attack immediately, when fifty against a thousand would stand small chance of escape.</p>
<p>It was nightfall before the first of the red-coated column appeared, and Percy and I, standing side by side, gripping our horses' muzzles, saw the formidable 63d Regulars as they came up with swinging stride even more than a thousand strong, and marched by our place of concealment with never a thought that the very prey for whom they were seeking might be near at hand.</p>
<p>My heart literally stood still for the time being, because even a lad unused to warfare knew beyond a question that should these men learn where we were hidden the end would come speedily. <a id="Page_155" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[155]"></a></p>
<p>I hardly dared to breathe, lest by so doing an alarm be given, and yet although fifty horses were concealed either side the road, not a sound was heard to betoken their whereabouts.</p>
<p>The regiment marched by; then came the Tory command under Major Harrison, which I believe was even more in numbers than Major Wemyss' men, and after them, more than a thousand yards in the rear, twenty Tory stragglers.</p>
<p>The major, my uncle, was stationed on the opposite side of the road from where Percy and I stood, and we had no knowledge whatsoever of his movements.</p>
<p>When these rascally traitors to their country lounged along, evidently believing themselves safe because of the large force in advance, the thought came into my mind that it would be a proper ending to our reconnoissance if we set upon them suddenly.</p>
<p>This idea had no more than come into my mind when we heard a crashing noise <a id="Page_156" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[156]"></a> from the opposite side of the road, and immediately the major appeared, followed by all who had remained with him, and we needed no other signal.</p>
<p>In a twinkling, as it were, the Tory stragglers were surrounded, and perhaps no more than sixty seconds elapsed before each man of them had been disarmed and was mounted behind one of our troop.</p>
<p>Then it can readily be understood that we put spurs to our horses, striking through the wooded country to the left in order to circle around the main body of the enemy, and the frightened prisoners had an opportunity of knowing that we raised good stock in Williamsburg district, for in less than an hour we were come to the Sinclair plantation.</p>
<p>The information for which we had sent was gained, and, in addition, we had twenty disconsolate-looking prisoners, who by this time had come to know that the Cause of freedom in the Carolinas was not yet wholly crushed out. <a id="Page_157" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[157]"></a></p>
<p>The renegades were herded into a stable, and, to the surprise of us all, no order was given to dismount.</p>
<p>That portion of the force which had been left behind with General Marion was in the saddle when we came up, and there they remained, as did we, while our officers, withdrawing to a clump of live oaks near at hand, entered into what proved to be a long, and certainly was a serious, consultation.</p>
<p>We knew full well that our future movements were being decided upon, and although there were more than two thousand armed men in the immediate vicinity searching for us, who would soon be joined by Tarleton's Legion, I believe there was not one of our brigade who did not hope most certainly that we would be pitted against them, desperate though the odds were.</p>
<p>Not until an hour before sunrise was the consultation come to an end, and then came the long expected order to advance. <a id="Page_158" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[158]"></a></p>
<p>"Ay; but in what direction?" Gavin Witherspoon, who was by my side, asked in a low tone, and the answer came later, when General Marion said:</p>
<p>"My men, it is the opinion of all in command that we return to Lynch's Creek, and I ask you to have confidence in us who have arrived at this decision, which is as painful to those who made it as to those who hear it. Nothing can be accomplished by staying here where capture or death must inevitably result; but so long as we remain at liberty, so long will the Cause live, and I promise you that however unpleasant and apparently disastrous may seem this move, you shall yet have many opportunities of striking at the British uniform. I ask that you follow, as you have done since I came among you, cheerfully and without question, believing that this step has not been decided upon without due deliberation."</p>
<p>"We are on the retreat," Gavin Witherspoon said to me as the general ceased <a id="Page_159" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[159]"></a> speaking, and the words were no more than uttered before a groan was heard throughout the entire line.</p>
<p>I here set it down, repeating the words that these brave fellows, only an hundred and fifty strong, could not repress their sorrow because at this moment, when we were threatened by over two thousand armed men, one-half of them well-trained troops, the word had been given to fall back.</p>
<p>It is proof of the spirit of patriotism which animated the hearts of those in Williamsburg district, that they were saddened only because of not being brought immediately face to face with an enemy which could conquer them by sheer force of numbers.</p>
<p>If the cause of liberty was crushed out elsewhere, it yet lived and burned with an ardent flame in the hearts of those who had pledged themselves to follow General Marion, and among these patriots Percy Sumter and myself had the good fortune to be numbered. <a id="Page_160" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[160]"></a></p>
<p>Well, we set out on what can be called none other than a retreat, for once we left the enemy behind us there was no other name for the move. The old camp at Lynch's Creek was the direct road to North Carolina, and the king's forces were hunting for us in Williamsburg district.</p>
<p>Now let it be fully understood what all that meant, and then in years to come no man may wonder why we whose homes were hereabout had sadness in our hearts.</p>
<p>For the first time since we had risen in our might against the king's oppression, were the people of Williamsburg and of Pedee to be left unprotected. Until this moment the enemy had never appeared in our neighborhood with such a force as enabled them to over-run it without fear of opposition.</p>
<p>Once we were gone our people must suffer the tender mercies of the Britishers and the Tories who had in other parts of the Carolinas, wherever they penetrated, written their names in blood and in flame. <a id="Page_161" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[161]"></a></p>
<p>Heretofore the James family, standing at the head of those who served the Cause, had kept this section of the Carolina colonies free from the invader. Now they were to leave it—to abandon it—while there were yet two thousand enemies in the district with more to come, and knowing full well that should they ever return again it would be to find their houses smoking ruins, their wives and children homeless and wandering. It was to leave behind all that was dear, and all that was sacred in order that the flame of freedom might, although burning feebly, yet be unquenched.</p>
<p>Even if Percy and I were yet lads, we were full grown in the knowledge of what had been and what would come, therefore, but in a lesser degree, of course, were we bowed down by sorrow as, setting our faces in that direction which would lead us away from home, we allowed the steeds to make their way at such pace as pleased them. <a id="Page_162" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[162]"></a></p>
<p>No man set spur on that ride; no man urged his horse forward, for it was as if we were held back by chains, and little wonder.</p>
<p>At the time this seemed to us to be a shameful march; but now I can look back upon it and realize how necessary it was—can understand that He who rules the destinies of nations had willed that, like the children of Israel, we should wander through the desert a certain time before we were come to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Now having set down all that was in our hearts at this time, let me hurry over such portion of the story, for it is not pleasant to dwell upon it.</p>
<p>We arrived at Lynch's Creek that evening, and here we were halted only so long as was necessary to make the arrangements already decided upon between our leaders.</p>
<p>Those who had families were requested, when we had come into the old camp, to leave the brigade and return home, there to remain until such time as they might be again summoned. <a id="Page_163" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[163]"></a></p>
<p>This was done in order that we might move more secretly, and also that those who were needed at home should be enabled to give to their loved ones at least the last words which might be spoken on earth.</p>
<p>Within an hour our force was reduced to sixty men, and yet there remained among us every member of the James family—a fact which went far toward cheering Percy and I in this retreat.</p>
<p>Five were there, John, William, Gavin, Robert and James, and each had a family; yet none would desert the leader in whom they had every confidence—none would desert the Cause, although it was come so low. Yet for the honor of those who dropped out, it must be said that they were ready at the first signal to rejoin the brigade.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon had a wife and five children, the youngest eight years old. To him I said, when, man after man, raising his hat in adieu, departed with an expression on his face which told of the sadness in his heart: <a id="Page_164" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[164]"></a></p>
<p>"It is for you to go also, Gavin. Such as Percy and I can well be spared, even though we leave behind a mother whom we love; but she has kinsfolk who will comfort her."</p>
<p>"My family are alone in the district, Robert Sumter, and yet they will be comforted, knowing that I am doing my duty as a man."</p>
<p>"Yet every one should care for his own, and you can well be spared when this movement is no more than a retreat."</p>
<p>"Ay, so I may be," the old man replied emphatically, and in such a tone as caused me to grip him heartily by the hand. "So I may be, and yet it would shame me to go, because now has come the hour of our adversity—the time when all hope seems to have fled; but my desire to free the colonies from the yoke of the king is as strong as when I first set out, nigh on to four years ago. I shall remain in the saddle, Robert Sumter, until we have won that toward which we set our faces, or a British bullet <a id="Page_165" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[165]"></a> has brought me low, and in the doing find happiness for myself as well as give comfort to those who look upon me for an example."</p>
<p>It was a brave man who spoke those words, and I said then in my heart that never again would I allow another to utter aught against Gavin Witherspoon—never again would I allow Percy or myself to laugh at his oddities or his whimsical fancies.</p>
<p>Freshly mounted were we who left Lynch's Creek at sunset on the day when we were arrived at the old camp, after those who went insisted on bringing to us their best horses and the major part of all their store of ammunition, because, in so doing, it seemed as if they were contributing in some slight degree to sustaining the Cause which they had long since despaired of seeing successful.</p>
<p>Dark days indeed were these which had come upon us; but they were needed, as was afterwards proven, to strengthen our <a id="Page_166" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[166]"></a> hearts for the future trial, which led us on to victory when defeat was seemingly already upon us.</p>
<p>From the hour of leaving Lynch's Creek until we were arrived in North Carolina, at Amy's Mill on Downing Creek, we never drew rein, save to halt that the tired steeds might find rest, and at this last encampment, we remained four and twenty hours.</p>
<p>From there a detachment of ten was sent back as scouts to gain intelligence of what might be going on in the lower Carolinas, and to cheer those of our number who had been left behind, in order that the fire of patriotism might be kept burning.</p>
<p>Then once more we took up the line of retreat, holding it until we were come to the east side of White Marsh, near the head of the Waccamaw River, where my uncle, the major, told us three comrades that a permanent camp would be established. <a id="Page_167" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[167]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00010">CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
<span class="s08">BLACK MINGO SWAMP.</span></h2>
<p>A protracted halt to men whose hearts are heavy is not a desirable boon, and so we from Williamsburg soon discovered.</p>
<p>The first idea in our minds, when we were come into camp and began to build shelters for ourselves, each after his own liking, was that we could enjoy this respite from a roving life, where it was necessary to be constantly on the alert against danger.</p>
<p>Once we had really settled down, however, and there was nothing of especial moment with which to occupy our attention, the hours moved so slowly as to seem like unto days.</p>
<p>At first we three comrades spent a goodly portion of the time speculating among ourselves <a id="Page_168" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[168]"></a> as to how long we might be able to hold the field against the numberless men which the king was sending in pursuit; but after a time we were wearied with such occupation, and began to long for active duty.</p>
<p>This isolation and sense of perfect security grew irksome, and there was not a man among the small detachment who would not gladly have faced a foe of five times our number, in order to shake off the lethargy which began to creep over him after eight and forty hours had passed.</p>
<p>On the fourth day after our having settled down in this encampment, Major James and Captain Mouzon were sent back into the lower Carolinas to make certain those who were enlisted in the Williamsburg brigade held steadfast to their pledges, and the absence of our uncle was to Percy and I like a great calamity. We looked upon him not only as the head of the family; but as a true friend and companion-in-arms upon whom we could rely under every circumstance, <a id="Page_169" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[169]"></a> and although not thrown much in his company because of the position we occupied in the force, the knowledge of his being near at hand, did we need his advice, was in itself a pleasurable satisfaction which we failed fully to realize until he was absent.</p>
<p>When a week passed and we were "rusting out," as Gavin Witherspoon said, it seemed absolutely necessary we have some employment, and the old man said to me one morning while Percy was making ready the breakfast:</p>
<p>"Three men have already been sent out as scouts since we came into this camp, and such duty is necessary because it stands to reason that the Tories will make every effort to discover the general's hiding-place."</p>
<p>"Ay, all you have said is true, Gavin Witherspoon," I replied; "but of what avail is it to us since the general calls upon others to act as scouts, forgetting that we readily performed such duty when it was <a id="Page_170" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[170]"></a> an hundred times more dangerous than at present?"</p>
<p>"This is how it may avail," the old man said in the tone of one who defies contradiction. "You shall go this morning to General Marion and offer the services of us three, promising that we will act as scouts so long as the detachment remains here."</p>
<p>"But if he refuses to detail us for such work?"</p>
<p>"Then pluck up sufficient courage to remind him that we went gladly, when, perchance, every man in the command would have hesitated. By so doing you may make him understand he owes something to us three."</p>
<p>At first thought I was not willing to browbeat our commander, for it appeared to me that what Gavin Witherspoon had proposed was little less than an attempt to bully the general into acceding to our desires; but the longer I considered the matter the more reasonable did it seem <a id="Page_171" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[171]"></a> that we should be sent out, rather than forced to remain in camp where our presence was of no possible benefit.</p>
<p>By going we should take away nothing of value from the encampment, and it might be possible fortune would so favor us that we could render some signal assistance, even though it did not seem probable there was any force of the enemy in that vicinity.</p>
<p>Therefore it was that I did as Gavin Witherspoon requested, and to our great surprise the general not only willingly gave his consent, but said it pleasured him much that we should so desire to serve the Cause.</p>
<p>"While we remain here waiting such turn in the tide of affairs as will give us an opportunity to serve the colonists, it is well to know thoroughly all the country and its inhabitants," he said in conclusion. "Therefore, so that you return to camp and report once in every four and twenty hours, you not only have my permission; <a id="Page_172" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[172]"></a> but will lay me under obligation by acting the part of scouts, spies or whatsoever you choose to call the officer."</p>
<p>It can well be understood that we did not linger long after this interview.</p>
<p>In less than an hour we three, provided with such store of provisions as would be our portion until the following day, and carrying an ample amount of ammunition, set out with no idea whatsoever as to where chance might lead us, save that it seemed wisest to travel toward the south, for in that direction lay home and friends.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon at once took command of the party by proceeding in advance, and we, having good cause to trust him implicitly, were more than willing to follow as he should propose.</p>
<p>There was no thought in our minds that a single enemy might be near at hand.</p>
<p>The only possibility counted upon was that we should run across one or more Tories seeking to find the encampment, and thus, perchance, prevent discovery. <a id="Page_173" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[173]"></a></p>
<p>Thus it was we proceeded with a certain amount of caution, although not deeming it necessary.</p>
<p>Until late in the afternoon we traveled along the banks of the Waccamaw River, our faces turned toward Williamsburg, and then Percy said, as he threw himself at full length by the side of the stream:</p>
<p>"We are come on a mission which cannot bear fruit, and it makes little difference whether we halt here, or five miles further on. Having remained so long in camp without exercise, my legs tire quickly, and I propose to rest for the night."</p>
<p>We were ready to gratify him in this respect, the more so because all of us were in much the same condition, and therefore it was that our scout came to an end, for the time being, hardly more than fifteen miles from the starting-point.</p>
<p>Surely we had no reason to grumble against fortune on this our first visit in the Upper Carolinas.</p>
<p>Such food as we had was ready cooked, <a id="Page_174" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[174]"></a> and in order to make camp it was only necessary to lie down among the bushes, where for a time all slept as we had not done during the time of idleness.</p>
<p>The sun was within an hour of setting when I awakened and found my companions lying in restful attitudes, but with open eyes.</p>
<p>They also had satisfied the desire for slumber.</p>
<p>How it chanced that we three remained there without speaking one to another, I know not; but so we did, strangely enough, and because of our unwitting silence were we enabled to accomplish that which had seemed improbable.</p>
<p>Human voices in the distance, but sounding nearer and nearer, attracted our attention, causing all three to rise and seek better concealment, when we saw through the foliage a party of seven armed men coming up the bank of the stream from the south, and proceeding with a certain degree of caution which told that <a id="Page_175" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[175]"></a> they were in search of something or some one.</p>
<p>Although not absolutely certain, we felt reasonably sure these travelers were enemies, and well we might, considering the fact that nowhere between here and the Carolinas was it known that any friends of the Cause had habitation.</p>
<p>When the party passed where we were in hiding, they had ceased conversation; therefore we had no means of determining who they were, save that all wore portions of a Britisher's accouterments, while our friends still held to the powder-horn and shot-pouch.</p>
<p>Not until they were lost to view in the distance did either of us speak, and then it was Percy who said, much as if he had made an important discovery:</p>
<p>"They are Tories, and searching for General Marion's encampment."</p>
<p>"I allow all that to be true, lad, and now what may be our duty?" Gavin Witherspoon asked. <a id="Page_176" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[176]"></a></p>
<p>"To learn where they halt for the night, and then carry the information back to camp," my brother said heedlessly, for indeed that seemed to be the only course left for us.</p>
<p>"There is in my mind a better plan, lad, and, if it so be you two are willing to take the chances, I venture to predict we will carry yonder gentlemen before General Marion, instead of hastening ahead to tell him they are coming."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that we three are to attack seven?" Percy asked, and the old man said with a smile:</p>
<p>"I have seen both you lads ride gallantly forward when it was a case of twenty against one, and yet you hesitate with the odds not much more than double against us?"</p>
<p>"Percy does not hesitate," I replied, jealous lest there should be a question as to the courage of one of our family. "So that it is in your mind, Gavin Witherspoon, <a id="Page_177" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[177]"></a> we will agree to anything that has the faintest hope of success."</p>
<p>"This is my plan: Yonder strangers are doubtless enemies; but if they prove to be friends, then have we done them no harm by carrying out that which is in my mind. We will follow so far in the rear that there is no danger of being discovered until they camp for the night, and then it will go hard indeed if we fail to find an opportunity for making them prisoners."</p>
<p>I did not agree with Gavin Witherspoon in his belief that we might readily make prisoners of seven men; yet was I well pleased to venture the attempt, believing something of good might come, even though we failed in the purpose. It was seldom we who held true to the colonies had an opportunity of striking even so slight a blow as this when the odds were no more than two against one, and it would have been folly for us to have refused such a chance.</p>
<p>Percy, once the plan was made plain, did <a id="Page_178" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[178]"></a> not consider it necessary to say whether he agreed to it or not.</p>
<p>To his mind, all who were acquainted with him should know he would favor any plan, and there was little need for Gavin Witherspoon to go further into details than he had already done.</p>
<p>"It is such work as this for which we left the camp," Percy said quietly, "and if the strangers are friends, we can atone for any rough handling by showing them the way to General Marion's camp."</p>
<p>This, so nearly as I can repeat it after these many years, was all that passed between us regarding the venture, and we set off on the trail without further delay.</p>
<p>There is less difficulty in successfully stalking a man than a deer, and this last had both Percy and I performed time and time again until it seemed to us like a simple task. Therefore it was that Gavin Witherspoon had no green hands to aid him in the work he had cut out.</p>
<p>Keeping so far in the rear as to hear the <a id="Page_179" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[179]"></a> noise as they forced their way through the underbrush, and yet not so near that we might by any possibility be seen, the three of us followed this little company who might be friends, but were probably enemies, until the going down of the sun, when we knew from such sounds as came to us that they had halted.</p>
<p>Now it was only a matter of waiting, which, under almost any circumstances, is the most difficult task to perform patiently; yet every lad who has hunted wild turkeys is well schooled in such work, and it can safely be said that we did not risk a failure by being over-eager.</p>
<p>The men, although having advanced with but little caution, realized the fact that there might be enemies in the vicinity, for they forbore building a camp-fire, and this fact rendered our work rather more difficult than it otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>After it was certain they had settled down for the night we stole nearer and nearer, until it was possible to hear the <a id="Page_180" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[180]"></a> conversation carried on in an ordinary tone, and then we remained motionless until the time for action should arrive.</p>
<p>When we were come thus far I believed we should hear such words as would declare whether these seven men were friends or enemies, and in this I was not disappointed, although we failed to learn anything of importance.</p>
<p>While eating supper one of them, in the course of the ordinary conversation concerning the tramp of the day, remarked:</p>
<p>"There is no probability we shall find any of the rebels during the next two or three days' march, for as yet we are among those who remain loyal to the king."</p>
<p>The words as written above were all we had to give us a clue to the character of these strangers; but they were sufficient.</p>
<p>We knew now, as well as if these men had explained at length, that they were in search of General Marion's encampment, and from that instant, answering for Percy as well as Gavin Witherspoon, I know that <a id="Page_181" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[181]"></a> the three of us counted on making a capture at whatsoever hazard.</p>
<p>Not until fully an hour after the men had stretched themselves upon the ground and the last word was spoken between them, did we make a move toward nearing the encampment.</p>
<p>Then it was that I would have gone forward, risking the danger with the belief that my life had better be made the price, rather than either of the others, when the old man laid his hand on mine as he whispered softly in my ear:</p>
<p>"It is for me to go, first, because I have had more experience in such work, and again, on the plea that I can best be spared to the Cause if either of us must pay a penalty for leading in the attack."</p>
<p>Although there may be the twang of a braggart in the words, still must it be set down that I tried to restrain Gavin Witherspoon, but without success.</p>
<p>When I would have pushed him away he held me back, and it seemed impossible <a id="Page_182" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[182]"></a> to advance without such a squabble as would have given the alarm.</p>
<p>I was absolutely forced to let him take the lead; but Percy and I kept close upon his heels.</p>
<p>When, after creeping so cautiously that not a twig snapped beneath our weight, we had come to the small cleared place on the bank of the stream which the men had selected as an encampment, we saw that they were sleeping near the foot of a pine tree that had been overturned by the wind.</p>
<p>The overhanging mass of roots formed a certain sort of shelter which served to protect them from the dew.</p>
<p>Their rifles were stacked against one of the branches at a distance of fully three yards from where they lay, and, as a matter of course, it was necessary to first secure possession of these.</p>
