<p>In this series of historical stories each one is complete in itself, yet taken together they form one of the most entertaining histories of the Revolution. The utmost care has been exercised to have them historically correct, and so much of romance as is used to make the tales stirring is subordinated to the facts. They have been written with the distinct purpose of portraying the struggle for liberty in romantic form, and while being in the highest degree interesting stories for the young, are at the same time especially instructive, inasmuch as the greatest possible amount of information is given.</p>
