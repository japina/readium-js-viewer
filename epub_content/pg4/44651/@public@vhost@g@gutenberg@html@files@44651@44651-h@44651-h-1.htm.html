<p class="caption">Then suddenly a redcoated Tory rushed toward me with upraised saber.—<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44651@44651-h@44651-h-1.htm.html#Page_49" class="pginternal">Page 49</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>There was to me a certain sense of satisfaction in the danger; a savage delight in shooting, with intent to kill, at the enemies of our country, and above all, the knowledge <a id="Page_49" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[49]"></a> that we were proving ourselves worthy a place in the James family.</p>
<p>I saw Captain Mouzon's horse fall, and looked with a certain curiosity to see how he might extricate himself from the weight of the animal.</p>
<p>I also wondered where Sam Lee might be, hoping it would be my good fortune to come upon him. Then suddenly, when my musket was empty, a redcoated Tory rushed toward me with upraised saber.</p>
<p>I tried to ward off the blow with my gun, knowing full well that I could not hope to be successful in such an encounter, and then the man suddenly fell to the ground as if stricken by a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>It was Percy who had brought the Tory down, thus saving my life, and I heard him, as one hears from afar off, cry impatiently:</p>
<p>"My last charge of powder is gone!"</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to say, and I have pondered over the matter again and again, why it was that the scene suddenly <a id="Page_50" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[50]"></a> changed, or how we three—for now that Captain Mouzon was on foot he did not count as one of our squad—emerged from that tangle of men, and found ourselves in pursuit of the fleeing, panic-stricken enemy. I remember clearly that one moment it was as if we were entirely surrounded, and the next, all was clear before us, save for that blotch of red in the distance which we pursued at the full speed of our horses, Major James shouting now and again as if to give us lads courage:</p>
<p>"If it so be that we ride hard they cannot escape us! Spare not your horses, lads, and we shall soon clear Williamsburg district of the nest of vipers that should have been crushed out years ago!"</p>
<p>I was near to smiling, despite the fact that this was a race in which human life had been put at stake, because our uncle should suggest that we might take any part in wiping out the "vipers," when our last charge of ammunition was expended, <a id="Page_51" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[51]"></a> and we carried no other arms than muskets.</p>
<p>Yet did we press on at his heels with all the speed of which Captain Mouzon's steeds were capable, eager to gain the advance if that might be, lest he should for a single instant fancy we had grown faint-hearted.</p>
<p>It was the first time we had had an opportunity of proving that the James blood ran in our veins, and had I been certain death awaited me at the end of that mad chase, I would have spurred my horse on yet faster, exulting in the thought that I might come to my end in such noble fashion as now, when following the lead of Major James!</p>
<p>Percy shouted like one who is without sense, and yet there was no thought in my mind of chiding him, for I understood full well why it was that the sound of his own voice seemed necessary—it was but the natural vent of the excitement that had taken hold of him like as a fever, and I <a id="Page_52" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[52]"></a> have since been told that I also cried out unmeaning words; but yet was unconscious of having done so.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the scene changed again, and with this transformation came into my heart what was very like fear.</p>
<p>One moment it was as if we had the whole of General Marion's force at our heels, and the next we were alone, riding down into that mass of fleeing Tories who outnumbered us two hundred to one, while not a friend of the Cause could be seen in the rear.</p>
<p>I saw Major James glancing over his shoulder, and involuntarily I copied the movement, although for thirty seconds or more had I known we were so far in the advance as to be practically cut off from our friends.</p>
<p>There was no change of expression in my uncle's face when he realized that we were come into sore danger—for now we were well upon the heels of the enemy;—but he looked at me as if asking whether the <a id="Page_53" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[53]"></a> knowledge of our situation brought timorousness into my heart.</p>
<p>I have ever been proud because at that instant I answered his inquiring look with such words as tickled his fancy mightily:</p>
<p>"There be three of us, Major, and more are not needed."</p>
<p>It was the speech of a braggart, but yet under such circumstances the words gave my uncle more confidence in our courage than almost anything else could have done, and an expression, which for the moment I took to be affection, came over his face as he replied in a ringing tone:</p>
<p>"God bless the sister who gave to me such nephews!" Then, waving his saber and shouting at the full strength of his lungs as if he had a thousand men behind him, he cried, "Here they are, boys! Here they are! Come on!"</p>
<p>I believe of a verity that the Tories fancied he was calling to a large force, rather than to two lads who were practically <a id="Page_54" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[54]"></a> weaponless, for their panic increased, if that could be possible, and they crowded upon each other's heels until the advance was impeded.</p>
<p>With fifty well-armed men at that time I venture to say we might have wiped out Major Gainey's entire force, and that officer himself was nigh to being taken prisoner when my uncle, spurring his horse into the very midst of the fugitives, singled out the leader as if challenging him to mortal combat.</p>
<p>Major Gainey, although he was a Tory, had never been called a coward; but on this morning he absolutely refused the challenge, and instead of halting to meet the foe as he would have done had his cause been just, he forced aside the weaker of his following, and succeeded in making good an escape.</p>
<p>"It was shame enough that one from Williamsburg should be a Tory," my uncle cried, brandishing his saber in impotent rage; "but that a Gainey would show himself <a id="Page_55" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[55]"></a> a coward as well, I have never believed until this hour."</p>
<p>It was strange indeed that of all the enemy we pursued so hotly and so closely, none turned upon us.</p>
<p>It would have been a simple task for a dozen of them, armed as we knew they were, to have allowed us to come into their midst, and then, closing, taken all three prisoners, or shot us down as might best have suited their fancy.</p>
<p>The fever of fear, however, was upon them until there was no thought in the minds of any save of individual safety, and during ten minutes or more we rode upon the heels of that retreating rabble, taunting them with such words as should have turned the faintest-hearted at bay.</p>
<p>There were seconds during that chase when I trembled with what was like unto a fear, realizing all which it was possible for them to do, and then that sensation would pass away while rage took possession of me because of my inability to do <a id="Page_56" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[56]"></a> other than lash the miserable Tories with my tongue.</p>
<p>Then Major James wheeled suddenly about, for we had come to the edge of Pedee Swamp, and, by his gesture rather than words, we understood that it was our turn to retreat.</p>
<p>The Tories were forced, because of the water, to ride more slowly, and should we still press upon them they must, even like rats, turn at bay; when, as a matter of course, the end would have come for us.</p>
<p>We had shown them what a man could do whose cause was just, and it would have been folly to continue on to the useless sacrifice of our own lives.</p>
<p>We turned about, as I have said, in obedience to my uncle's signal, and rode to the rear faster than we came, for now was there fear some of the cowardly foe might shoot us in the back, and before drawing rein we came upon General Marion and Captain M'Cottry.</p>
<p>These two were, like ourselves, far in <a id="Page_57" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[57]"></a> advance, and by reining in his horse the general forced us to halt.</p>
<p>Now occurred that which I shall ever remember with the most intense pride and satisfaction so long as the breath remains in my body.</p>
<p>He who was to be afterward so well-known as the "Swamp Fox," he who was the bravest among all the brave men in the Carolinas, leaning forward in the saddle held out his hands, one to each of us lads, and said in a tone so hearty that there could be no mistaking the sentiment in his heart:</p>
<p>"I have ever believed the members of the James family to be true to their country, their friends, and to themselves; but never before had I expected to see two boys ride at their kinsman's call straight into what seemed certain danger. I am proud indeed that you were eager to seek service under my command, and promise that if my life be spared you shall have fitting opportunity to show your devotion to the Cause." <a id="Page_58" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[58]"></a></p>
<p>We lads were unable to speak because of the pride and pleasure which filled our hearts to overflowing; but my uncle, taking off his hat with more of homage than I had ever seen him bestow upon any other man, made reply:</p>
<p>"When General Marion is pleased to speak such words to members of my family, he places under obligation every one of us."</p>
<p>"There can be no sense of obligation, Major, when the praise has been won so handsomely."</p>
<p>"In that I agree with you, General, and more particularly because neither of my nephews had a charge of ammunition. After the first rush they followed bravely, although virtually weaponless, and I am happy to be able to call them my sister's sons. The ride is completed, and we now await your orders."</p>
<p>"Have all the force escaped?" the general asked.</p>
<p>"Ay, sir, all save those who may have <a id="Page_59" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[59]"></a> been rendered unable to continue the retreat. They are in Pedee Swamp where it would be worse than folly to make any attempt at following them."</p>
<p>The general wheeled his horse around, motioning Percy and I to ride by his side, and together we returned to where the main body of our brigade was halted.</p>
<p>Here after a short time we learned that a captain and nine men had been killed from among the Tory force, while our loss amounted to only two wounded, and it was safe to say that many days would elapse before Major Gainey's regiment could be got into fighting shape again.</p>
<p>There was no reason why any of us should longer suffer from hunger, for we were in possession of the Tory camp where were provisions in abundance, and during an hour we feasted, Percy and I, as only lads can who have been without food nigh on to four and twenty hours.</p>
<p>Then, when believing it would be possible to return to our home for a short time—and <a id="Page_60" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[60]"></a> we were eager to tell our mother of the proud distinction we had won—word was brought by one of the troopers that General Marion would speak with us.</p>
<p>I venture to say there was not a man in the brigade who did not envy us two lads as we went toward that portion of the thicket where the commander was seated under a live oak tree with his officers clustered about him, and I am also quite certain that of all the force, we two had the least right to be praised or singled out for preferment.</p>
<p>Among those who served the Cause in the Carolinas there were no cowards; it appeared much as if the timorous ones turned Tories because, by professing to serve the king, a colonist is not required to bear so many hardships or encounter so many dangers, as those who would throw off his majesty's yoke. Therefore it was that when an officer like General Marion selected two from among all that gathering, it was indeed a great distinction, and <a id="Page_61" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[61]"></a> we understood by his sending for us that we were like to be called upon for an especial service, as he had already intimated.</p>
<p>Although unused to such a life as we had so suddenly embarked upon, Percy and I contrived to salute the general in something approaching military fashion, and he, returning it, asked in the tone of a friend rather than of one who commands:</p>
<p>"Are you lads minded to set out on a venture which has in it much of danger?"</p>
<p>Percy looked at me as if to say that I should act as spokesman, and I replied more readily than perhaps was courteous, fearing lest it might be fancied we hesitated:</p>
<p>"Aye, sir; that we are, and the more of danger the more readily do we set out. I say this last not in a boasting manner, but to show you, sir, that we are right willing to lay down our lives for the good of the Cause which our uncle serves."</p>
<p>"It is well spoken, young sir. I had <a id="Page_62" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[62]"></a> no doubt of your willingness; but rather made mention of the danger that you might have an opportunity to draw back honorably, if it so be you shrank in any degree from the task, for it is one through which little honor can be gained, although the service must be performed."</p>
<p>"We are ready for whatsoever pleases you, sir," I said, and Percy laid his hand in mine that it might be understood he repeated the words.</p>
<p>"Between here and Dubose Ferry—the precise location you must yourselves determine—one Captain Barfield lies encamped, having under him a force not less than four hundred strong. Our purpose is to advance upon him immediately; but having learned that there is a possibility his men may far exceed ours in numbers, it is necessary we have full information before venturing an attack. Are you minded to seek him out, and learn all that may be ascertained within a few hours, returning to us before nightfall?" <a id="Page_63" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[63]"></a></p>
<p>"We will set out at once, sir. Captain Mouzon lent us horses that we might join in the march, and perhaps he will allow us to use them in this service," I said, turning toward the captain, who replied readily:</p>
<p>"That you may, lads, and in welcome. I am right glad that the Mouzon stables can furnish mounts for such riders as you have shown yourselves to be."</p>
<p>"Then we will set out at once, sir," I said to the general. "The horses have already been cared for, and should be able to make the journey without distress."</p>
<p>"There is no time to be lost. You yourselves are to decide how the information we desire can best and most safely be obtained, for it would be unwise to hamper you with advice or commands. At about noon the brigade will set out at a slow pace in the direction of Dubose Ferry, and I hope you may be able to meet us several miles this side of the encampment. We shall ride so nearly as may be in a <a id="Page_64" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[64]"></a> straight line, and at about nightfall keep sharp watch for your approach. The most important information is as to the number of the enemy; then the general position of the camp, and, finally, how it may be best come upon."</p>
<p>Having said this the general saluted, as did the officers round about him, and Percy and I, understanding that we were dismissed, would have moved away, but that the major, my uncle, stepped forward, taking us each by the hand.</p>
<p>He spoke no word; but I understood that he was bidding us good-by, and his manner of doing it told me, had such information been necessary, how dangerous was the mission with which we were charged.</p>
<p>Again the general and his officers saluted, and then we, turning on our heels, set about making ready for the departure.</p>
<p>Some of the men lounging nearabout would have spoken with us; but I was not minded to indulge in conversation just at <a id="Page_65" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[65]"></a> that moment, and it seemed much as if Percy had the same idea.</p>
<p>Beginning to realize more fully each moment what this duty on which we were embarked might mean, I feared lest we grow faint-hearted because of the perils. To have spoken with any one regarding the service, would have been to show us more plainly all that it meant, and silence was safest if we would hold our uncle's good opinion.</p>
<p>The horses were saddled, and we about to mount when Gavin Witherspoon, whom I had not seen since the attack, came up hurriedly and with the air of one who is in a fault-finding mood.</p>
<p>"So! We are much puffed up with pride, eh, since it has been our good fortune to follow Major James in pursuit of a lot of scurvy Tories? We don't care to speak with old friends?"</p>
<p>"Now you are disgruntled without cause, Gavin Witherspoon," Percy said laughingly. "How may it be possible that we <a id="Page_66" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[66]"></a> speak with old or new friends when we fail to meet them. Since you dropped the fish so hurriedly, we have not had a glimpse of your face, and I question if you cared to meet us until, perhaps, within an hour."</p>
<p>"I have been looking for you high and low since we came to a halt here."</p>
<p>"Then it must be your eyes are grown dim with age," I said, now joining my brother in his mirth, for the old man's anger was comical rather than serious. "We unsaddled our horses in this spot, and have remained until within ten minutes under this same tree, therefore it could not have been a difficult matter to find us."</p>
<p>"But there is no reason for fault-finding, and we have little time to spend in conversation," Percy added.</p>
<p>"You will speak with me though!" Gavin said, seizing the bridle of my horse as if fearing I was about to ride away. "In what direction are you two lads going?" <a id="Page_67" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[67]"></a></p>
<p>"That we may not say," Percy replied quickly. "It is enough that we are acting upon General Marion's orders."</p>
<p>"That is as I suspected," Gavin cried, shaking his fist at Percy as if the lad had proven himself guilty of some serious crime. "You would slip away from the old man, believing yourselves so wondrous brave that he isn't fit to join in any adventure however trifling?"</p>
<p>"Now you are talking wildly, Gavin Witherspoon," I said, losing my patience, for, knowing we had but little time at our disposal, I was fretted by what seemed to me no more than folly. "We have been entrusted with a duty which must be performed immediately, and may not stand here parleying with you over trifling matters."</p>
<p>"It is my intention you shall remain until I can have speech with General Marion, or failing him, with Major James."</p>
<p>"Why should we wait for that?" Percy asked, leaping into the saddle, and as he <a id="Page_68" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[68]"></a> did so the old man seized the bridle of his horse also.</p>
<p>"Because I am counting on going with you. I promised your mother six months or more ago that when you two lads were minded to turn soldiers I would keep an eye upon you, and now has come the time when I must fulfil the pledge, or write myself down a liar."</p>
<p>I knew enough of the old man's character to understand that we could not browbeat him into loosing his hold of the bridle, and was not minded to ride over him. Therefore said with as much of patience as I could assume:</p>
<p>"So that you move quickly, we will wait until you can speak with either officer you name; but remember, Gavin, we are under orders to set off without delay."</p>
<p>"What have you in the way of weapons?"</p>
<p>Until this moment, strange as it may seem, I had entirely lost sight of the fact that we were virtually unarmed, and now <a id="Page_69" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[69]"></a> I realized the folly of setting out so wholly unprepared.</p>
<p>"We must have ammunition if nothing more," I said hurriedly, "and while you are gone in search of the general, I will set about procuring it. Therefore the time spent in waiting for you will not be wasted."</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon now seemed to have every confidence that we would not slip away from him, and hurried off toward the other end of the encampment, while I went from one acquaintance to another in search of powder and ball.</p>
<p>In this quest I was more successful than had seemed possible.</p>
<p>Knowing that we lads had been entrusted with a mission, the men bestirred themselves to see that we were outfitted properly, and soon our store of ammunition was even greater than could be used to advantage.</p>
<p>We had two horns full of powder, thirty or forty balls, and a couple of pistols; <a id="Page_70" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[70]"></a> more than that would have hampered our movements.</p>
<p>Perhaps no more than ten minutes had been spent in outfitting ourselves, and yet this time was sufficient for Gavin to make his preparations to accompany us, as was shown when he rode up while I was dividing the ammunition with Percy.</p>
<p>"Is it really your purpose to follow us?" I asked in surprise, for it had not seemed to me probable the old man would be allowed to join in the venture.</p>
<p>"I am not countin' to <i>follow</i>, lads; but ride side by side with you, and perhaps somewhat in advance. I'm not thinkin' of letting you go on this mission alone—"</p>
<p>"It may be safer for two than for three," Percy said half to himself, and the old man, without so much as turning his head, replied solemnly and in such a tone as impressed me strangely:</p>
<p>"There is nothing whatsoever of safety in an attempt to ride from here to Dubose Ferry, for two, or even a dozen of those <a id="Page_71" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[71]"></a> who love the cause. My going with you will neither increase nor lessen the danger, because that is impossible. It may be, however, that I can give a word of advice which will prevent your coming to a final end quite so soon, for I hold to it that General Marion and Major James have this day sent you lads to what is little less than death."</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, and in a manner well calculated to disturb even the stoutest hearted lad, the old man wheeled his horse about and rode in the direction of Dubose Ferry, never so much as turning his head to see if we were following him. <a id="Page_72" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[72]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00006">CHAPTER IV.<br/>
<span class="s08">SAMUEL LEE.</span></h2>
<p>Had Gavin Witherspoon been less strange in his manner, I should have taken little heed of his joining us in the mission with which we had been entrusted by General Marion, because the old man was often given to whims, and this could well have been considered as simply a fancy on his part to indulge in the love for adventure.</p>
<p>If he had contented himself with vague words concerning the possible danger, neither Percy nor I would have paid any particular attention to him, believing he simply magnified the peril in order that it might appear as if he counted on being able to protect us.</p>
<p>His manner, however, was so exceeding <a id="Page_73" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[73]"></a> odd—I can find no word which comes nearer explaining it—that I believed at once he was in possession of some knowledge which we did not share, and therefore had good reason for crediting all he said.</p>
<p>A year later, perhaps, after I had had more experience in what some gentlemen are pleased to call the "art of warfare," I might have held my peace, trusting in our ability to ward off such dangers as should arise, but then, ignorant as we were of a soldier's life, the old man's actions impressed me disagreeably, as I have said already, and I was minded to demand from him an explanation.</p>
<p>Never before had I found it a difficult matter to gain speech with Gavin Witherspoon, for the old man was prone to indulge in conversation regardless of suitable opportunity or place; but on this morning Percy and I found it necessary to ride at full speed in order to come alongside our self-appointed guardian, and we were, perhaps, five miles from the camp when I <a id="Page_74" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[74]"></a> finally succeeded in forcing him to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"If you count to ride with us, Master Witherspoon, and claim that it is your purpose to protect Percy and I, we at least have the right to know why such an escort is considered necessary."</p>
<p>"That I have already explained," the old man replied curtly, and would have spurred ahead of us once more but that Percy caught his bridle rein, as he said sharply:</p>
<p>"We are minded, Gavin Witherspoon, to know the meaning of your mysterious words and odd behavior. If it so be you know more concerning the enemy than is told among the men of our brigade, let us hear it now, that my brother and I may be in some degree prepared for coming events."</p>
<p>"I have ridden with the command, and had no more means of gaining information than others. What may be in my mind has come there through what I call sound commonsense." <a id="Page_75" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[75]"></a></p>
<p>"And you have reasoned out that we are in greater danger than we were four and twenty hours ago?" I said with a laugh, beginning to feel somewhat of relief in my mind by this discovery, as I believed, that the old man's fears were the result of his own imagination.</p>
<p>He must have read in the tone of my voice somewhat of that in my mind, for, reining in his horse, he wheeled around to face Percy and myself as he replied, speaking slowly and with exceeding earnestness:</p>
<p>"It was known to the leaders of our brigade that Captain Barfield had a force of Tories nearabout Dubose Ferry. Think you Major Gainey and his men did not have the same information?"</p>
<p>"Of course they did," I replied, wondering greatly what the old man would come at.</p>
<p>"It is no more of a journey from Pedee Swamp to Dubose Ferry, than from where we halted for breakfast." <a id="Page_76" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[76]"></a></p>
<p>Again he paused as if waiting some reply; but neither Percy nor I spoke, for as yet we failed to understand what he was trying to convey.</p>
<p>"Major Gainey's force has lost an outfit, since our people took possession of it, and must, therefore, seek another encampment. Do you believe they will be content to remain in the swamp, knowin' their friends are near at hand?"</p>
<p>"It would be reasonable that they rode in the direction of the Ferry," Percy said, an expression of deepest seriousness chasing away the smile which had been upon his lips.</p>
<p>"Very well. Since you allow that, there is no need for me to say more. It is the general belief that Gainey had near to two thousand men with him, an' think you they will not fight, however much cowardice may be in their hearts, when next we ride upon them? If these two forces of Tories come together—and by this time I venture to say the men we routed in the early dawn <a id="Page_77" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[77]"></a> have begun to understand how few we are in numbers—I look to see hot work. Therefore it is I predict that before arrivin' at Dubose Ferry we shall meet with many of those who so lately fled before us."</p>
<p>I now realized why the old man looked upon the situation as being grave in the extreme, and there was no further inclination in my mind to make sport of his forebodings.</p>
<p>Having learned what it might, perhaps, have been better we did not know, Percy and I became quite as solemn as was Gavin Witherspoon, and we three rode on again as if certain some evil fortune was about to overtake us, neither so much as speaking until half an hour or more had passed, when we came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>Our road at this time lay through the bottom-lands, which were covered with a growth of scrub oaks, and we had heard a noise as of horsemen forcing their way through the foliage.</p>
<p>This it was which had caused us to halt so <a id="Page_78" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[78]"></a> suddenly, and I was looking to my rifle to make certain it was loaded, when Sam Lee came into view.</p>
<p>He was riding a heavily-built iron-gray horse, the very animal I could have sworn to seeing during the brush with Major Gainey's force. Upon his face was an expression of deepest satisfaction and joy, which did not change materially when he saw us.</p>
<p>Percy, quicker than I at such times, cried out for the Tory to halt, and he wisely obeyed the command, knowing full well his steed would have no show in a race with such animals as we bestrode, even though our rifles might not have brought him to a halt.</p>
<p>"Well," he asked, with an evil look upon his face. "Since when have you begun to stop peaceful travelers?"</p>
<p>"We have not yet commenced," I cried, allowing anger to take possession of me. "In these times a Tory cannot lay claim to peacefulness, and it is our purpose to <a id="Page_79" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[79]"></a> make such prisoners whenever and wherever we find them."</p>
<p>"And I am a prisoner, eh?" he asked, with not the slightest show of fear, and I was surprised thereat, because we knew him to be a rank coward.</p>
<p>"Throw down your musket an' hold up your hands while Percy makes search for pistols!" Gavin Witherspoon said sternly, for the old man was a ready comrade in times when quick action became necessary.</p>
<p>Sam Lee obeyed without a word, and after a brief search we discovered that he had no other weapons than the musket which lay upon the ground.</p>
<p>Still he appeared well satisfied—even pleased.</p>
<p>It angered me yet further, this show of carelessness, and I cried hastily:</p>
<p>"You were in no such happy mood this morning, when we chased your friends into the swamp—when less than four hundred men put to flight two thousand!"</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon turned upon me <a id="Page_80" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[80]"></a> quickly, and with such a show of temper as caused me to understand in an instant that I had thus given to the enemy information concerning the size of General Marion's force.</p>
<p>It was too late to recall the words, unfortunately, and Sam, giving no heed to the old man's show of resentment at my folly, replied to the words which I had believed would humiliate him:</p>
<p>"The condition of affairs in the Carolinas have changed wonderfully within the past few days, and we who are loyal inhabitants of the colony have little to fear from rebels."</p>
<p>Now did I realize that this Tory lad was certain of his ground, else he would not have dared to speak in such strain, and the result was that I, rather than our prisoner, grew disheartened.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon also pricked up his ears at this bold speech from the lad who had heretofore been so cowardly as never to venture an opinion lest he make trouble <a id="Page_81" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[81]"></a> for himself, and the old man asked as he advanced toward the rascal threateningly:</p>
<p>"What is it that has given you such a dose of courage, you Tory cur?"</p>
<p>Sam winced, as if believing Gavin Witherspoon was about to strike him, and then, understanding an instant later that we were not of his kidney, who would ill-treat a prisoner, replied with a laugh which aroused all my anger again:</p>
<p>"Your General Gates with his rag-tag and bob-tail of an army has been cut to pieces at Camden by Lord Cornwallis! What you are pleased to call the 'Cause,' is now wiped out from the Carolinas!"</p>
<p>We three sat speechless with dismay, gazing at each other questioningly, apprehensively, as the young Tory told a story which we at the time believed to be true, and afterward came to learn that no part had been exaggerated.</p>
<p>General Gates, who believed himself to be more of a soldier than was the fact, had moved from Rugely's Mills on the <a id="Page_82" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[82]"></a> evening of the 15th, with his entire force, never so much as sending scouts in advance to learn whether the enemy might be in the vicinity. His raw recruits were suddenly met by a volley from the British skirmishers, and, retreating so far as seemed necessary for safety, lay upon their arms until morning.</p>
<p>When the sun rose any other general than Gates would have known he was defeated, even before trying the issue. His men, unused to service, were formed in the swamp with the reserve only a few hundred yards in the rear of the battle line. Perhaps not one out of ten of these had ever been under fire, and opposed to them were picked soldiers—the best to be found in the king's regiments stationed at Charleston and Camden.</p>
<p>At sunrise General Gates ordered the advance of the Virginia militia, who were met by the redcoats with such a deadly volley that the division retreated before more than half of them had discharged <a id="Page_83" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[83]"></a> their muskets. The North Carolina militia followed the disgraceful example, as did also the cavalry, and a charge by the British horse completed the rout.</p>
<p>Only the Continentals under command of De Kalb held their ground until further resistance would have been madness, and the battle of Camden had been half fought, and wholly lost.</p>
<p>No wonder Sam Lee was triumphant.</p>
<p>To us who heard the story it seemed as if his boast that the Cause had been killed in the Carolinas was neither more nor less than the truth, and for a moment I fancied it our duty to return without loss of time to warn General Marion.</p>
<p>Now it may seem strange to whosoever shall read these lines, that we believed so readily all the Tory told us; but we had good cause for credulity.</p>
<p>Old soldiers among us—and the men of my mother's family had been in arms from the time the colonists first began resistance against the king's oppression—had again <a id="Page_84" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[84]"></a> and again argued that General Gates was not a skilful officer, despite his victory at Saratoga.</p>
<p>When it was known that General Marion, who up to the time of taking command in the Williamsburg district had been only a colonel, was to leave the staff of Gates, our people predicted a disaster similar to what it seemed had just occurred.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sam Lee, liar and coward though he was naturally, gave us an account of the battle with so much of detail he could not have invented, we, unfortunately, had no choice but to believe the tale.</p>
<p>It was Gavin Witherspoon who first regained sufficient composure to understand what should be done, and he soon showed the Tory that, however hardly our people had been used, it would not avail him under the present circumstances.</p>
<p>"It seems to me necessary we keep this young cub with us, however disagreeable the association may be, and do you lads <a id="Page_85" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[85]"></a> lash him on the saddle in such fashion that he will not be able to make his escape without assistance."</p>
<p>Although believing for the moment that we ought to return immediately to General Marion, I obeyed the old man's order, and now it was that the look of satisfaction and exultation began to vanish from the coward's face.</p>
<p>He had counted on our so far losing heart as to make an attempt at currying favor with him, or, at least, pass him by, and our thus guarding against the possibility of escape was by no means to his liking.</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" I asked when the lad was secure, for I now realized, as did Percy, that Gavin Witherspoon should be given the command of our squad.</p>
<p>"We shall push on as was at first intended, keeping our wits well about us, lest we be surprised by others of this fellow's kidney, who are making haste to join Barfield. After having accomplished <a id="Page_86" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[86]"></a> that for which we were sent, if it be possible, there will be time enough to repeat the disagreeable story."</p>
<p>I am making an overly long story of what should be told in fewer words, prompted to do so because of the fear which beset me at this time and caused the matter to seem of more importance than it really was.</p>
<p>We pressed forward two hours or more, Percy and I riding either side of the prisoner, and Gavin Witherspoon keeping in advance.</p>
<p>Then we were come, as nearly as could be judged, to the vicinity of the Tory camp, and might no longer with safety use the horses.</p>
<p>Still acting under Gavin Witherspoon's command, we picketed our steeds in the thicket, leaving them and the prisoner to the charge of Percy, while the old man and I pressed forward to reconnoiter.</p>
<p>This work occupied a full hour, and the time was by no means wasted, because <a id="Page_87" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[87]"></a> when it had expired we were well informed as to the number of Barfield's men.</p>
<p>To the best of our belief there were not less than eight hundred Tories fairly well entrenched at Dubose Ferry, and Gavin said to me as we turned to retrace our steps:</p>
<p>"There will be no fighting this night, unless we are driven to it, for neither General Marion nor Major James, however brave they may be, will make the attack with such odds against us, particularly while it is certain this same force of Tories will be reinforced before nightfall by those whom we drove into the swamp."</p>
<p>A similar thought was in my own mind, and therefore I made no reply.</p>
<p>It was necessary we rejoin our friends before they should have come so far as to put themselves in a dangerous position, and Gavin and I hurried back to where we had left Percy.</p>
<p>We had no difficulty in finding the place where we tethered the horses, and once <a id="Page_88" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[88]"></a> there the cold sweat of fear broke out upon my forehead.</p>
<p>Percy, and prisoner, and the three horses which we had ridden, were not to be seen. But for the fact that the gray steed of Sam Lee was feeding close by, I would have said we had mistaken the location.</p>
<p>Words are not sufficient to describe my condition of mind when this horrible truth burst upon me. I could not so much as speak; but looked questioningly at the old man, who said slowly and in a half whisper, after gazing carefully around:</p>
<p>"The boy has been captured by some of Gainey's cowards who no doubt are hunting for us at this moment. Sam Lee knew for what purpose we went ahead, and as a matter of course has given his Tory friends all possible information."</p>
<p>"Why do we stand here idly?" I cried, regaining speech when the horrible fact had been put before me in words. "We cannot desert him, and at whatsoever cost must go in pursuit." <a id="Page_89" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[89]"></a></p>
<p>"It is not possible we could compass anything save our own capture," Gavin Witherspoon said, speaking slowly, and gripping hard both my hands as if to give me comfort.</p>
<p>"Surely you will not turn your back upon him," I cried in a fury, trying to wrench myself from his grasp; "if that cowardly thought be in your mind you shall go alone, for I had rather face all Barfield's force single-handed, than have it said I deserted my brother."</p>
<p>"Fair and softly, Robert Sumter, fair and softly. I am not minded to go back. It is you who shall do that."</p>
<p>"But I will not," and again I strove to release my hands.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, lad, and the sooner the better for your brother's sake, because I shall hold you here by force until having laid the case squarely before you. Would you have it told that one of the James family, on account of his own personal grief, allowed four hundred brave men to <a id="Page_90" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[90]"></a> ride on to destruction? Would you have it said that rather than desert your brother you allowed the men of Williamsburg to face certain capture or death? Yet that is what must happen unless you are willing to do as I bid."</p>
<p>"But let me hear what is in your mind, for until then how can I answer the questions you ask!" and now I was grown more tractable, understanding that the old man knew better than I what was necessary both for the safety of Percy, and those who were riding behind us.</p>
<p>"There is but one horse here, and it would be unsafe to set out on foot. Having had many more years of experience than you, I should be more capable of following the Tories who have Percy in their keeping, and having come upon them, if there be a chance for his rescue, ought to be able to take better advantage of the opportunity than you. Now this is my plan: Mount the gray horse and ride back until you have met our friends; tell them what has occurred, <a id="Page_91" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[91]"></a> and perchance Major James will send forward ten or twelve experienced woodsmen, who will help me in what seems little better than a forlorn hope. At all events, the gentlemen whom we both can trust implicitly will know the situation, and advise what we may do with honor. In addition to that you will be spared the pain of confessing in later days that you did what a James should never do—left your friends to ride blindly into such danger as has never before come upon men of the Carolinas."</p>
<p>It was not easy to follow this advice, as may well be imagined, and I spent fully five minutes trying to force myself to do it.</p>
<p>It seemed as if by going back when Percy had been forced to go forward, I was deserting him, and yet such seeming desertion was necessary to save, perhaps, the entire Williamsburg district.</p>
<p>"You will return as a brave lad should," the old man said finally, and, my heart <a id="Page_92" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[92]"></a> well-nigh bursting with grief, I made reply by mounting the gray horse.</p>
<p>Not until then did I realize how much Gavin Witherspoon had taken upon himself.</p>
<p>The old man was voluntarily remaining behind on foot, surrounded by enemies, in the vain hope that he might by some fortunate accident rescue Percy, and I knew full well that the chances were as one in a thousand that it could not be done.</p>
<p>In other words, he was doing little less than delivering himself into the hands of the enemy and I—I was deserting him as well as my brother.</p>
<p>"I can't do it, Gavin," I said, making as if to dismount. "It is better you ride back."</p>
<p>"No, lad. Having once come to a brave decision, hold steadfast, and forget all else save that the Cause demands the sacrifice, perchance of your life, and certainly of your feelings. Push the horse at his best pace, which will be a sorry one at the most, <a id="Page_93" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[93]"></a> and before many hours have passed we may grasp hands again; but I solemnly swear not to desert Percy whatever may come upon me."</p>
<p>I clasped the old man's hand, understanding for the first time in my life what a friend he was. Then, not daring to so much as speak, I set the spurs deep into the gray, and he bounded forward with more of life than I had expected it would be possible for him to show.</p>
<p>The wonder of it all to me is now, while I am writing it down after so many months have passed, that I was not captured before having traversed a mile on the backward journey, for I saw nothing, heeded nothing, thought of nothing save Percy and the brave old man who was following on his trail.</p>
<p>Heedless alike of friend or foe I rode as if in all the district of Williamsburg there was not an enemy, and the good God allowed me to pass through that Tory infested district in safety. <a id="Page_94" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[94]"></a></p>
<p>It was no more than two hours past noon when I came upon the advance guard of our brigade, and five minutes later stood before my uncle and General Marion, shaking like one in an ague fit.</p>
<p>Those brave soldiers needed not to be told that some disaster had befallen us. The fact, although not the story, was imprinted plainly on my face, and Major James dismounted that he might fling his arm around my shoulders, as he asked softly and tenderly:</p>
<p>"How far beyond here did you leave Percy and Gavin Witherspoon?"</p>
<p>"Within three miles of Dubose Ferry, so nearly as I can say."</p>
<p>"Were you come upon Barfield's force before this thing happened?"</p>
<p>Then it was that I found my tongue, and told him all the sad story, taking good care however, that both he and the general understood full well the strength of the enemy as we had found them.</p>
<p>"We will fall upon them as soon as may <a id="Page_95" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[95]"></a> be," the general cried, and beckoning to Captain Mouzon he would have given some order but that I said hurriedly, forgetting my manners, as well I might, after all that had happened:</p>
<p>"Gavin Witherspoon declared that Major Gainey's men would join Barfield's force, and should the Williamsburg brigade advance, it would be only to their capture or death."</p>
<p>"Death is what every soldier must expect, and peradventure it be delayed until the end comes peacefully, then is he less fortunate, perhaps, than his fellow. We will ride on, gentlemen, and attack Barfield as soon as we can come upon him." <a id="Page_96" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[96]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00007">CHAPTER V.<br/>
<span class="s08">THE AMBUSH.</span></h2>
<p>Had the men composing the brigade all been akin to me they could not have shown greater kindness, nor done more to soothe my grief, than they did during the brief time before the march toward the Tory encampment was really commenced.</p>
<p>One found immediately a better steed; another brought assurances from Captain Mouzon that I was not to think for a single instant of the loss of his horses, since it was only the fortunes of war, which must be expected. A third would have pressed food upon me; but I could not have swallowed a single morsel unless, perchance, life itself might have depended upon the act.</p>
<p>My uncle, Major James, said very little <a id="Page_97" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[97]"></a> after hearing the story we had gotten from Sam Lee.</p>
<p>At first I attributed his silence to the apprehensions which had come upon him with the knowledge that General Gates had been overwhelmed; but later I had good reason to believe it arose solely from anxiety concerning my brother.</p>
<p>"You shall ride by my side, lad, until we have settled this affair, and when it is done neither you nor I will have cause to reproach ourselves for not having ventured enough."</p>
<p>Such a promise from such a man was sufficient to tell me that while he and I remained alive, we would struggle as men do who have no fear of death, until the dear lad was rescued, or we borne down by press of numbers.</p>
<p>At this day it seems singular to me that I heard no one speak of the great disaster which had come upon the colonists at Camden.</p>
<p>I can only explain it by the supposition <a id="Page_98" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[98]"></a> that each man saw in the adventure before us an opportunity to do somewhat by way of retaliation, and set all his thoughts on that purpose.</p>
<p>We were halted, after my rejoining the brigade, twenty minutes or more, and then the word to advance was given; but not in such fashion as I had supposed from what General Marion said, on his learning of the disaster which had come upon Percy.</p>
<p>My idea was, and in my ignorance I saw no other method of procedure, that the little troop would ride into Barfield's Tories even as they had among those commanded by Major Gainey, and that we should profit by the surprise.</p>
<p>This could not be done, as I afterward came to realize.</p>
<p>The capture of Percy, and what Sam Lee could tell, would be sufficient to prevent us from coming upon them unexpectedly.</p>
<p>When the Tory lad should inform the commander that two of Major James' <a id="Page_99" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[99]"></a> nephews were in that vicinity, it would be immediately known that our uncle, with a goodly following, was somewhere nearabout.</p>
<p>The Tories would be prepared, and those who had suffered defeat that morning must have, by this time, a very good idea of our strength.</p>
<p>General Marion, as I afterward came to know full well, was not the man to neglect any precaution, and while he counted on making an attack despite the difference in numbers, it was his intention to do so in such manner as would come nearest to guaranteeing success.</p>
<p>Fifty of the best mounted men were detached and sent straight toward Dubose Ferry, while the remainder of the brigade rode off at right angles, in such direction as would bring us to the timber lands eastward of the road leading to Indian Village.</p>
<p>It was this last portion of the force which my uncle and I accompanied, and I, surprised <a id="Page_100" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[100]"></a> that a part of the brigade rode at full speed, while we loitered, as it were, asked the reason.</p>
<p>"Those in advance are mounted in such fashion that they may easily outrun the enemy, and it is the plan that they appear before Barfield's force as if intending to make an attack," my uncle replied. "After thus showing themselves the squad will beat a retreat, causing it to appear as if they were surprised by seeing so large a force. Then, unless the Tories are quicker witted than I give them credit for being, a goodly portion of the band will be led into ambush."</p>
<p>It was the Indian's favorite method of warfare, and, cruel though I had ever considered it, at this moment it gave me most intense pleasure.</p>
<p>I had said to myself that we could hope to do little less than die in the vain attempt to rescue Percy; but now it seemed as if, should our lives be demanded as a sacrifice, we might sell them dearly. <a id="Page_101" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[101]"></a></p>
<p>Well, all went as our commander had counted upon.</p>
<p>We hid ourselves in the thicket either side the road, three hundred and fifty horsemen, with not a man dismounted, for we counted upon riding the Tories down when they should retreat after the first volley had warned them that they had been led into a trap.</p>
<p>There we waited upwards of an hour, no man venturing to so much as speak, and each looking well after his steed lest one of the animals whinny at the supreme moment, thus giving the enemy a clew, before they were fairly within our grasp, of what awaited them.</p>
<p>During that hour I resolutely kept my thoughts on trifles, such as caring for the animal I bestrode, making certain I was in such position that it would be possible to get out of the wood with the least possible delay when the enemy was thrown into confusion, and by these and other means prevented myself from dwelling upon Percy's fate. <a id="Page_102" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[102]"></a></p>
<p>Then came that sound for which we had waited—the thunder of horses' feet upon the beaten road.</p>
<p>We heard cries of fear, which were uttered by our decoys to entice the Tories into yet hotter pursuit, and far in the distance could be distinguished the crack of rifles and the rattle of muskets.</p>
<p>At that time, with the blood literally boiling in my veins and my heart beating like the blows of a hammer, I never stopped to question how many of ours might be killed in this attempt to deal out punishment to the enemies of the colonies; but realized only that now was come the moment when I could strike a blow in defense of my brother.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the horsemen, until through the trees we saw the Williamsburg men riding madly down, not a saddle emptied, and before one could count twenty the advance of the Tories came in sight.</p>
<p>A whispered word went around among <a id="Page_103" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[103]"></a> us to "hold ready," although every man was on the alert, and when the road in front of us appeared to be one dense mass of horses, and men wearing red uniforms, my uncle gave the signal for which we waited:</p>
<p>"Fire, boys, and at them!"</p>
<p>From each side the road rang out reports of rifles which had been leveled in deadly aim, for at such short range each could pick his man and make certain of bringing him down.</p>
<p>Instantly the ranks were broken; the redcoated horsemen reined in their steeds as the squad they had been pursuing halted and fired their volley, and then came a scramble and retreat when we dashed among them.</p>
<p>Twice I loaded and discharged my rifle, and then it seemed to me as if such work was all too slow.</p>
<p>Using the weapon as a club, I rode by my uncle's side into the very midst of that scrambling, terrified mass of human beings, <a id="Page_104" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[104]"></a> and cried aloud with savage joy when I struck one of the frightened villains down.</p>
<p>As was afterward learned, there were no less than one thousand men who had set out in pursuit of our decoys, and yet after our first attack not one of them remained to hold us in check.</p>
<p>Had they been only so many sheep, we could not have found them easier prey.</p>
<p>The major, my uncle, had said I should ride by his side, and so I did, down the road at the heels of the Tory scoundrels, ever as we had done the night previous. Then on, and on, striking down a foe here and there until we were come, nearly the whole brigade, into that encampment which Gavin Witherspoon and I had looked upon, believing it could not be taken by such a force as ours.</p>
<p>Out of all those scoundrels who had so lately held the place, believing that those true to the Cause had been virtually crushed by the defeat of General Gates, <a id="Page_105" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[105]"></a> only two men came forth to meet us, and those two, my brother and Gavin Witherspoon.</p>
<p>Is there any need I should say how warm was the greeting between us two lads when I threw myself from the horse and clasped to my heart the dear boy whom I had thought never to see again in this life?</p>
<p>It needed no more than an hundred words for him to tell his story.</p>
<p>While he remained in the thicket guarding Sam Lee a body of men, who had lately served under Major Gainey, came upon them by chance, and, as a matter of course, he was at once taken prisoner, Sam Lee immediately telling the story of his own capture.</p>
<p>Then it was the Tory Sam who became the jailer, and Percy the prisoner.</p>
<p>My brother was conducted to Barfield's camp, and there kept under guard of Sam, who did all that lay in his power, save by way of personal violence, to pay off old scores. <a id="Page_106" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[106]"></a></p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon, wily as an Indian, had crept up to the very edge of the encampment, and was lying there in the vain hope that some opportunity would come for the rescue, when our force, sent as a decoy, appeared.</p>
<p>An hundred or more men were left to guard the encampment, and Gavin hoped the moment had come when he might be of service to the lad.</p>
<p>Believing that the Tories would be victorious in the chase, because of superior numbers, he ventured too near Percy, and was himself captured.</p>
<p>An hour later the first of the terrified fugitives burst into the encampment, riding straight through it in their wild terror, thus causing a panic among the guard who might even then, because of their intrenched position, have held us in check.</p>
<p>In a twinkling Percy and Gavin were free; but in imminent danger of being ridden down by the panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Crouching behind trees, or at the stronger <a id="Page_107" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[107]"></a> portions of the intrenchments, they awaited our coming, and when we rode into camp came forth to greet us as I have said.</p>
<p>Our force remained in the captured quarters until next morning, and during the evening Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself had much to talk about.</p>
<p>My brother and I were come by this time to look upon the old man as a comrade, and well we might, after the friend he had proven himself to be.</p>
<p>While we talked only concerning ourselves, and looked after our own welfare, General Marion and the officers of the command spent the time discussing how it might be possible for so small a force to uphold the cause in the Carolinas, for since the defeat of Gates ours was the only body of men in the colony to oppose the foe.</p>
<p>It was as if the king's troops had indeed crushed what they were pleased to term "rebellion," and more than one man in the brigade whose fidelity to the Cause could <a id="Page_108" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[108]"></a> not be questioned, asked his comrade if it were wise to longer remain in arms when we were virtually whipped.</p>
<p>The outlook was gloomy indeed for those who had hoped to be freed from the burdens the king had put upon them; but, fortunately for the Cause, General Marion and Major James were not the men to give in beaten so long as life remained.</p>
<p>Even while some among us were making ready to say openly that the time had come when we must submit, those two gallant gentlemen were planning for the future—planning as to how four hundred or less might best oppose ten times their number of trained soldiers.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself, while listening to the faint-hearted ones or discussing the situation between ourselves, hoped that the general would call upon us for some especial mission, even as he had when we were sent to spy out Barfield's camp; but the time was not come when we were needed for a venture of any <a id="Page_109" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[109]"></a> moment, as we learned an hour before daybreak next morning.</p>
<p>Then the men were aroused with orders to breakfast from the Tories' provisions as hurriedly as might be, and make ready for the forced march.</p>
<p>Among those with whom I talked, when in the gray light we made our preparations for the march, not a man believed there was the slightest question we should continue upon the offensive.</p>
<p>All understood that we could not in safety remain much longer in the Tory camp, for unless those whom we had routed were greater cowards than was generally believed, they would soon recover from the panic into which we had driven them, and return to make an attack.</p>
<p>Therefore it was that we set out believing the move was made simply for the purpose of changing quarters, and when orders were given that each man take from the Tory stores so much of provisions for himself, or provender for his horse as could be <a id="Page_110" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[110]"></a> carried conveniently behind him, we fancied it was the general's purpose to so outfit the brigade that it might lay in hiding two or three days without being forced to venture forth in search of food.</p>
<p>Before noon came, however, all understood that some maneuver was in progress.</p>
<p>Instead of riding rapidly, as would have been the case had we counted on simply exchanging one encampment for another, we went forward at a leisurely pace, making no halt until the sun was high in the heavens, when we were come to the ford on Black River, half a dozen miles or more south of Kingstree.</p>
<p>Then the men and horses were allowed a rest of an hour, after which we bore nearly due west until we struck the road leading from Georgetown to Nelson's Ferry, and the word was whispered from man to man that the commander had it in mind to strike yet another blow at the red-coated enemy before we laid down our arms. <a id="Page_111" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[111]"></a></p>
<p>It is well known, as a matter of course, that the "war-path" from Charleston to Camden crosses Santee River at Nelson's Ferry, and here, above all other places, would one who was eager for fighting be likely to get his fill.</p>
<p>More than once during the day had we learned from planters, who were true to the Cause, additional particulars concerning the blunder of General Gates, and before nightfall we understood beyond a peradventure that the story told by Sam Lee was only untrue in so far as it did not contain all the disasters which had befallen the American arms.</p>
<p>Now we knew how many prisoners had been taken, and, what was more to the purpose, learned that our unfortunate countrymen were being sent as rapidly as possible from the scene of the one-sided conflict to Charleston.</p>
<p>It was an hour before sunset, and we were holding the same pace at which we started, with no evidence of going into <a id="Page_112" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[112]"></a> camp, when Gavin Witherspoon said bitterly, as if the thought had just seized him:</p>
<p>"Lads, if it so be you have any curiosity concerning this long march of ours, during which we have traversed the Williamsburg district apparently for no other purpose than to come upon an enemy who may crush us with but little trouble, I can satisfy you."</p>
<p>"Have you been getting some special information?" Percy asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Aye, lad, that I have, and you may count upon its being true, although I got it only from my own head."</p>
<p>"Then you are guessing as to where we are going?" I said with no great show of enthusiasm, for I was weary to the verge of exhaustion with long remaining in the saddle.</p>
<p>"It is more than guessing, lad. It is what has been learned from observation, and that is the most reliable information a man can obtain. We are heading for Nelson's Ferry." <a id="Page_113" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[113]"></a></p>
<p>"If that is all your observation has taught you, it would seem as if much time had been wasted," Percy replied laughingly. "Every man in the brigade has known as much since noon."</p>
<p>"True, lad, but that is not the sum of the information I am willing to give. It has been told us that the American prisoners which Lord Cornwallis took are being sent to Charleston as rapidly as possible, and you will admit with me that all must pass through this same place toward which we are bound. It is General Marion's purpose to strike another blow, if no more, at the enemy, and in so doing set free some of those who were made prisoners through their general's stupidity."</p>
<p>There was much of sound common sense in Gavin Witherspoon's reasoning, and straightway the truth of it came into my mind, all sense of fatigue was lost sight of in the relief which was mine at knowing we would not yet submit to the Britishers, <a id="Page_114" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[114]"></a> even though it seemed as if we were already driven to the last extremity.</p>
<p>A moment before the old man gave words to his thoughts, I would have said that both the animal I bestrode and myself were so near to exhaustion that we could not hold the pace an hour longer; but now it was as if I had enjoyed a long time of repose, and action was absolutely necessary, lest I grow rusty with much idleness.</p>
<p>We three discussed the possibility of the future as if all Gavin Witherspoon had suggested was known to be true, until one of the general's aides came riding down the line, drawing rein in front of us, as he said curtly:</p>
<p>"The general would speak with you."</p>
<p>"We have not been forgotten," Percy cried gleefully, "and now has come our time to render some immediate service."</p>
<p>"Or fall into the hands of the enemy," Gavin Witherspoon added with a smile. "These special missions are not the safest, and sometimes he who sets out on them <a id="Page_115" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[115]"></a> with the idea of making his name famous, comes to grief."</p>
<p>"As I did yesterday," Percy replied, still laughing. "When I have as comrades you and Bob, it matters little how much of unpleasant adventure I see, save for the discomfort of the moment."</p>
<p>Then the dear lad spurred his horse onward, and we two followed, Gavin Witherspoon wearing a serious countenance, while I was in much perplexity as to whether two lads like Percy and myself should be trusted with work such as old soldiers oftentimes fail at doing successfully.</p>
<p>Arriving at the head of the line we found the general and Major James riding side by side.</p>
<p>Both returned our salute, but neither slackened speed, and we rode alongside of the general, Percy and I, while Gavin remained slightly in the rear.</p>
<p>"We should be within twenty miles of Nelson's Ferry," the commander said, speaking as if we were eager for such <a id="Page_116" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[116]"></a> information. "It is certain that portions of Cornwallis's force guarding American prisoners will pass there from time to time within the next eight and forty hours. It is my desire that we have early information of such coming and going, and to that end I have sent for you, lads."</p>
<p>He paused for an instant as if debating in his mind what to say next, and Gavin Witherspoon rode up that he might attract the general's attention, when the latter said with a smile:</p>
<p>"I am speaking to you two lads and the old man who is so eager to participate in venturesome missions. Any force coming from Camden will halt over night, at least, nearabout the Ferry. By riding up the river ten miles or more you should be able to give me timely information of their coming. Within an hour we shall halt, and then it is you who must push forward so far as the animals can go. Continue on until having come to a point ten or twelve miles above the Ferry. There remain, in <a id="Page_117" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[117]"></a> whatsoever fashion may please you, until you hear of the enemy's approach. Then wait only so long as may be necessary to learn how strong he is in numbers, after which you will ride without delay to Taw Caw Creek, on the bank of which we shall be encamped."</p>
<p>Having said this he saluted, as did my uncle, and we three, understanding that this was the signal for dismissal, reined in our steeds until we were fallen back to our proper place in the line.</p>
<p>The knowledge that we were to perform some especial work which bid fair to be of service to the Cause, heartened us wonderfully, and indeed we had need of something to raise our courage, for much talking about the disasters which had overtaken the American troops caused it to seem as if the so-called rebellion was well-nigh come to an end.</p>
<p>"It may be our last chance of striking a blow at those who represent the king, lads," Gavin Witherspoon said cheerily. <a id="Page_118" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[118]"></a> "Mayhap we shall be fortunate if a British bullet finds lodgment in our bodies with sufficient force to wipe us out of existence, for such a death as that is preferable to hanging, and that is what awaits us of Williamsburg who defy his majesty, after my Lord Clinton's second proclamation."</p>
<p>"It is a doleful way you have of preparing one for venturesome work," Percy said, with a laugh which told that he claimed little share in these forebodings. "If to be shot is good fortune, then we may rejoice, for I doubt not but that there are hundreds of the king's servants who will readily grant such a favor."</p>
<p>"I am not minded to dishearten you," Gavin said in a kindly tone; "but the straits into which the Cause has fallen are so sore and desperate now, that to an old man like me who has ventured all, it would seem as if a soldier's death, coming before the last blow to the colonies had been struck, was a kindly thing. However, we are like to go ten miles above Nelson's <a id="Page_119" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[119]"></a> Ferry and back, without falling into more harm than was brought about by the capture of Sam Lee, and I venture to say we shall report in proper form and due time such information as the general desires."</p>
<p>Then we fell silent, each intent on his own thoughts, and at that moment I was thinking far more of my mother than of the Cause, for Gavin Witherspoon's words had depressed me until it began to appear as if I might never see her dear face again.</p>
<p>From this pleasant but yet painful reverie I was roused by the halting of the command, and Percy said, seizing me by the arm as if believing I had fallen asleep:</p>
<p>"The time has come for us to push forward alone, Bob, and we must make as many miles 'twixt now and dark as can be forced out of these jaded steeds." <a id="Page_120" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[120]"></a></p>
