<p class="caption">As Gavin gathered up the weapons, Percy and I called upon the sleepers to surrender.—<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44651@44651-h@44651-h-3.htm.html#Page_183" class="pginternal">Page 183</a>.</p>

<p>Gavin did his work, as we knew beyond a question he could do, and when he raised himself beside the weapons, we two, Percy <a id="Page_183" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[183]"></a> and I, sprang to our feet, calling upon the sleepers to surrender.</p>
<p>They had no other choice than to obey, and sheepish indeed were these seven after we had drawn them up in line, when they understood how small was the force which had taken them prisoners.</p>
<p>Yet were they reasonably good men, so far as Tories go, inasmuch as no one spoke a word, all refusing to answer the questions which we asked.</p>
<p>So far as we ourselves were concerned this made little difference, and without delay, although they as well as ourselves were fatigued, most likely, by the long tramp, we began the return to General Marion's camp.</p>
<p>As it proved later, our capture was of great importance, even though the prisoners stoutly refused to give information when the general questioned them, for their presence showed that Tarleton was hot after us, knowing somewhat of our whereabouts, and the time was come when we <a id="Page_184" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[184]"></a> must retreat yet further, or return to the task of showing the invaders that the spirit of liberty in these southern colonies was not yet crushed out.</p>
<p>Now let me set down here what we had learned since the day when we set free the one hundred and fifty Continentals who refused, save in the case of the three true men, to join our force.</p>
<p>Major Wemyss had marched for seventy miles from Nelson's Ferry, straight across the district of Williamsburg, desolating a path fifteen miles in breadth after such merciless fashion that one would have said he had been taught in the schools of the savage.</p>
<p>All the dwellings on his way, save those habited by well-known Tories, were given to the flames; the people were plundered of their possessions; such property as the troops could not use was destroyed, while the animals were wantonly shot and allowed to rot where they fell.</p>
<p>Those who were thus plundered saw all <a id="Page_185" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[185]"></a> their belongings swept away by fire, and they, even to the women and children, were held forcibly back to prevent them from saving the smallest article of value.</p>
<p>Men were hanged without semblance of trial, and when their loved ones pleaded for mercy, the British soldiery rode them down.</p>
<p>All the time it seemed almost as if the good God had forsaken the colonies, and yet we came to know that all these acts of barbarous cruelty were necessary to arouse our people from the fear and the despondency into which they had fallen.</p>
<p>It did arouse them.</p>
<p>It forced men into the ranks of the patriots who otherwise would have waited quietly by until the colonies or the king should have proven a right to the country.</p>
<p>Within two days from the time the seven scouts were taken prisoners and we had arrived at our encampment, the hour was come when we should return, and among <a id="Page_186" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[186]"></a> those on the banks of the Waccamaw who held steadfast to General Marion, there was no one who did not rejoice because the moment for action was at hand.</p>
<p>Taking the prisoners with us, we set out on a forced march, which was continued night and day until we had seen the sun rise and set three times while we yet remained in the saddle, save when it was absolutely necessary to give rest to our steeds.</p>
<p>Then we were come to Lynch's Creek once more—to the old camp—where we found all those who had waited behind until the signal should be given, with the addition of more than two hundred new recruits—men who had been driven by the cruelty of the king's hirelings into the ranks of those who would save their country.</p>
<p>More than this, those whom we met gave information that Major Wemyss had retired to Georgetown, wearied with chasing the Swamp Fox, and a body of six <a id="Page_187" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[187]"></a> hundred well-armed Tories were encamped near Black Mingo Swamp, fifteen miles below where we were halted, under command of Captain John Ball.</p>
<p>Here was our work cut out for us, and like the true patriot and ardent soldier that he was, General Marion gave us no cause to complain of hesitation on his part.</p>
<p>It was less than four hours from the time our command was halted, and while yet we were exchanging greetings with those who had parted from us so many days before, that our commander, calling the men in a body around him, thus spoke:</p>
<p>"Hardly more than two hours' ride from here are encamped a force of these renegades whom we call Tories. They outnumber us slightly; but even though there were twice as many, yet I believe you who have served so gallantly under me since I came into the Williamsburg district, could whip them in the open field. We are told that recruits are flocking from <a id="Page_188" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[188]"></a> every quarter of this portion of the colony to join us, and by waiting we may double our strength; yet at the same time it is possible that the enemy will take the alarm and flee. I propose that we march at once, and within twenty-four hours from the time of returning to the scene of our labors strike such a blow as shall give Tarleton and Wemyss to understand that the spirit of liberty has been revived, rather than broken, by their butcheries and their barbarities."</p>
<p>A ringing cheer, in which every man participated, was the answer to this speech, and more than that no commander could need.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, it could not have been more, we were in the saddle, led by two sons of Captain Waties, who had already made themselves familiar with the approaches to the enemy's camp, and Major James, my uncle, said as he reined his horse in that he might fall back between Percy and I for a moment: <a id="Page_189" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[189]"></a></p>
<p>"Lads, we have once more taken up the work, and with such a commander I venture to predict that it will not cease, until the last adherent to the Cause has yielded up his life, or we have brought the Carolinas out from under the sway of the butchers."</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon, who had been riding slightly in the rear, spurred his horse forward until he could speak with my uncle:</p>
<p>"Whereabout in the Black Mingo are these scurvy scoundrels encamped?"</p>
<p>"At Shepherd's Ferry on the south side of the stream."</p>
<p>"Then we must cross that bridge on planks, if I mistake not, in order to come at them?"</p>
<p>"You are right, Gavin."</p>
<p>"And so many horsemen as we number may not be able to do that without giving an alarm."</p>
<p>"It is a chance which we must take. Whether they have warning of our approach, or not, from the moment we reach the causeway our advance must be rapid." <a id="Page_190" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[190]"></a></p>
<p>Then my uncle rode ahead to join General Marion, and we, tired and sleepy from being long in the saddle without proper hours of rest, relapsed into silence until we were arrived at this same bridge of which Gavin had spoken.</p>
<p>It was midnight, and I had said to Percy that all the odds were in our favor, so far as taking the enemy by surprise was concerned, when the foremost of the troops clattered across the planks.</p>
<p>Within sixty seconds an alarm gun was heard from the Tory encampment.</p>
<p>Now was come the time, and the first, when we two lads were to take part in a conflict where the enemy was expecting us.</p>
<p>It would be a real battle, and Percy cried, clasping my hand as we spurred our horses on at a gallop lest we be left in the rear:</p>
<p>"We may perchance come to our death, Bob, before the sun shall rise again; but it shall never be said that we failed to follow the head of the family wherever he might lead!" <a id="Page_191" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[191]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00011">CHAPTER IX.<br/>
<span class="s08">THE BATTLE.</span></h2>
<p>Of the battle, short, sharp and bloody, which followed after we had given the alarm by riding across the plank causeway into Black Mingo Swamp, I can set down but little of my own knowledge, because Gavin Witherspoon, Percy and myself were with what was called, for the time being, the "cavalry," and we saw only that portion of the engagement which fell to our share.</p>
<p>However, I have heard my uncle tell the story again and again in these words, and there can be no doubt as to its correctness, however the historian of the future may write concerning the action:</p>
<p>"After the alarm gun sounded, promptness and swift riding became as necessary <a id="Page_192" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[192]"></a> as had caution, and the general ordered his men to follow him at a gallop until the force reached the main road, about three hundred yards from where it was known the enemy lay.</p>
<p>"Here, with the exception of a small number who were to act as cavalry, the entire command dismounted. A body of picked men under Captain Waties was ordered down the road to attack Dollard's house where the Tories had been posted. Two companies under Hugh Horry were sent to the right, and the cavalry to the left, to support the attack, Marion himself bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>"It so happened, however, that the Tories had left the house immediately after being alarmed, and were strongly drawn up in a field near at hand.</p>
<p>"Here it was they encountered Horry's command on the advance, with a fire equally severe and unexpected. The effect was that of a surprise upon the colonists. Horry's troops fell back in confusion, but <a id="Page_193" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[193]"></a> were promptly rallied and brought on the charge.</p>
<p>"Immediately the battle became obstinate and bloody; but the appearance of the men under Waties, who came up suddenly in the rear of the Tories, soon brought it to a close. Finding themselves between two fires, the enemy gave way in all directions to flee for refuge to the neighboring swamp of Black Mingo."</p>
<p>This is the story of the battle as I have heard my uncle tell it many times.</p>
<p>As for the part which we three comrades played, I can say but little in detail.</p>
<p>When the advance was ordered we rode forward eagerly, for inaction had whetted our desire, and once more we gave the renegade sons of the colony a much needed lesson.</p>
<p>To me the engagement was not as desperate as either of the others in which Percy and I had taken part, for at no time did we of the cavalry come to a hand-to-hand encounter with those who chose to serve a <a id="Page_194" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[194]"></a> king whose only delight was in oppression; but that it was a real and a bloody battle was known full well after we had gained possession of the field, for then our officers learned from such prisoners as had been taken, that the enemy outnumbered us two to one, and of all those engaged, true colonists as well as false, a full third were killed or disabled.</p>
<p>Our loss was great, when one takes into consideration the fact that we made the attack, and that it was in a certain sense surprising.</p>
<p>Captain Logan was killed; Captain Mouzon and Lieutenant Scott so severely wounded that even though their lives were saved it would be impossible for them to do active service again, and more than an hundred people were dead or disabled.</p>
<p>Among the Tories the execution had been great; Captain Ball was dead, and a full two hundred lay on the ground lifeless, or wounded to such an extent that retreat was impossible. <a id="Page_195" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[195]"></a></p>
<p>In addition to that, we had among us one hundred and two as prisoners, and they who had a few hours previous believed the Cause of freedom in the Carolinas was dead, now pleaded eagerly to be allowed to enlist.</p>
<p>They had no love for country; but were ready as ever to join such force as appeared to be gaining ascendancy, and this one victory had put the Cause on a different footing from what it had been since the day we made the attack upon the Prince of Wales' regiment at Nelson's Ferry.</p>
<p>In discussing this engagement afterward, Gavin, Percy and I have decided, to our own satisfaction at least, that not one among our leaders had any idea of the good which might result from what was little less than a chance encounter when the king's officers believed we had been whipped into submission.</p>
<p>We ourselves almost became weary of it as the days passed and this man or that, <a id="Page_196" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[196]"></a> who had previously declared his allegiance to the king, came into camp, begging the privilege to enlist under the banner of General Marion.</p>
<p>But I am getting ahead of my story, and it is little wonder, for on the night before the battle at the Black Mingo we had considered ourselves outlaws, whose only hope lay in striking one or more severe blows before death should befall us. Then to find that the Cause had suddenly received a new lease of life was so unexpected and happily surprising, that even at this late day I cannot forbear a sense of triumph such as I did not know even on the day peace was declared, when these colonies had become a free nation—a nation such as I doubt not will one day be a power in the world.</p>
<p>We laid in this captured camp sufficiently long to give all our friends opportunity of joining us, and the faint-hearted inhabitants nearabout time to declare their pretended love for the Cause, before <a id="Page_197" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[197]"></a> attempting to continue the lesson to the red-coats which had been so long delayed.</p>
<p>It was during this time of inaction that we were joined by a young man hardly older than myself, who was destined to make the fourth in our comradeship.</p>
<p>This was none other than Gabriel Marion, the general's nephew, a lad loved by our commander as if he had been a son, and on whom one might pin his faith, knowing full well it would never be betrayed.</p>
<p>This Gabriel did not resemble his uncle in feature, else might we never have come to take him to our hearts as we did. The general wore a somber countenance, while the lad was ever smiling, however great the danger which threatened.</p>
<p>The general rarely spoke in a jovial tone, while Gabriel never lost an opportunity of uttering a jest.</p>
<p>Within half an hour after he rode into the captured camp at Shepherd's Ferry the general sent for Percy and myself, and, when we presented ourselves, introduced <a id="Page_198" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[198]"></a> his nephew much in the following fashion:</p>
<p>"This lad is as dear to me as a son, and his honor, his courage and patriotism as near to my heart as my own, therefore do I present him to you two lads whom I know to be true and faithful to whatsoever you set your word. Make of him a comrade, and you will please me; hold him to his duties as you hold each other, and you will benefit him."</p>
<p>No words could have been more flattering or more pleasing to us, and it can well be imagined that we were especially careful from this day out to merit the continuance of the same favorable opinion.</p>
<p>Gabriel was a lad whom all would love immediately after knowing him, and once having formed his acquaintance, he was found to be the same one day as another,—a true, lovable comrade.</p>
<p>To him, as a matter of course, we told all that had come to us, since we were regularly enrolled as members of his uncle's <a id="Page_199" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[199]"></a> force, and in so doing spoke necessarily of Sam Lee.</p>
<p>Although we held ourselves ever ready to meet any enemies of the Cause, it was that young Tory whom we especially hoped to come across.</p>
<p>If I have not heretofore set it down strongly, let it be understood we had never come to a new neighborhood without a strong hope that he might be met, and the three of us were resolved to capture him at the first opportunity whatever the hazard, for in all the Carolinas could be found no more bitter enemy than this same lad who had taken sides with the hirelings of the king simply because of his own vicious nature.</p>
<p>"Without good reason therefore, Sam Lee is, I believe, bent on doing all possible harm to us of Williamsburg, and when we have made him prisoner, holding the scoundrel so close that he cannot escape until the Cause be won or hopelessly lost, we shall have accomplished a good work," <a id="Page_200" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[200]"></a> Percy said when I had finished the story regarding that young Tory.</p>
<p>"How may he, a lad without influence, do so much mischief?" Gabriel asked, and Gavin Witherspoon replied promptly:</p>
<p>"It is because of being a mere boy that gives him the advantage. Unless our friends know him for what he is, it would naturally be thought that he was incapable of harm. I had rather have him in my clutches than any man short of a major in the British service."</p>
<p>"What prevents our setting out some day and bringing him into camp?" Gabriel asked with a merry laugh; but there was no need I should answer the question, for he knew full well had it been possible we would have had the Tory within our grasp long before this.</p>
<p>Just how many days we remained in camp at Shepherd's Ferry I am unable to set down, because there was much to occupy our time, although such occupation <a id="Page_201" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[201]"></a> was not directly connected with the Cause.</p>
<p>We four comrades were constantly being sent out as scouts, or to urge that the planters near at hand bring in food, so that one day went by after another with exceeding swiftness and so much of pleasurable intercourse that it was more like a merry-making than a struggle against a mighty king.</p>
<p>However, the day came when word was whispered round about the camp that we were to set out at once for Lynch's Creek, to make an attack upon Colonel Harrison and his Tory Legion.</p>
<p>While we were preparing for the journey, good friends came in with tidings that the renegades were gathering in large force in and about Salem and the fork of Black River.</p>
<p>Here it was, so we were told, that Colonel Tynes of the British service had appeared, summoning the people as good subjects of his majesty to take the field <a id="Page_202" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[202]"></a> against their countrymen, and he brought with him ample supplies of war materials, provisions, and even of luxuries such as our people had not seen for many a month.</p>
<p>Eager though we were to be at Harrison's Tories, the tidings of new muskets with bayonets, broad swords, pistols, saddles, bridles, and of powder and ball which the Britisher had brought with him caused our mouths to water.</p>
<p>Had General Marion neglected to take advantage of such opportunity as seemed suddenly to have presented itself, I believe the men of his brigade, obedient and faithful as they had been, would have burst into loud murmurings, for we were sadly in need of equipments.</p>
<p>Before the day on which this information was brought had come to an end, others who were friendly to the Cause arrived with the definite information that Colonel Tynes was encamped at Tarcote, on the forks of Black River, and apparently so secure in mind regarding his position <a id="Page_203" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[203]"></a> that such watchfulness as common prudence would have dictated was neglected.</p>
<p>It was just such an advantage as General Marion delighted in; exactly the kind of work for which we of the brigade were best adapted, and every man was in a fever to be at the task which was at one and the same time for the benefit of the Cause and the better equipment of ourselves.</p>
<p>While the officers deliberated, the rank and file announced what articles they most needed, as if it were only necessary to make the statement in order to have their desires fulfilled, and, in short, there was not one among us but that believed we could have for the choosing anything in Colonel Tynes' stores.</p>
<p>Tarleton with his Legion was hot after us, and so every one knew; but thus far we had failed to meet him, and between his force and ours was that gallant general of Carolina, my father's kinsman, General Sumter standing ever ready to interpose lest Tarleton should fall upon General Marion <a id="Page_204" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[204]"></a> when he was least prepared, and who delighted in leading that British butcher on a wild-goose chase.</p>
<p>Truly we two, Percy and I, had reason to be proud of the men to whom we were bound by ties of blood, for the names of Sumter and James stood high, and with good cause, among the defenders of the Carolinas in those dark days when armed resistance seemed little short of suicide.</p>
<p>I realize that this task which Percy has insisted I shall perform is being done in a halting fashion, because of my speaking overly much, perhaps, of those who remained true during the darkest days known by the southern colonies; but yet how may it be possible to tell any portion of the story of the Carolinas without mentioning again and again the names of those patriots who ventured life and fortune when such sacrifice seemed hopeless?</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a id="i220"/> <img src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44651@44651-h@images@i-220.jpg" alt=""/>
<p class="caption">In the darkness we four comrades were sent forward to reconnoitre.—<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@44651@44651-h@44651-h-3.htm.html#Page_205" class="pginternal">Page 205</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>However, just now must be told what we of the Williamsburg district did with the overly confident Colonel Tynes, and yet <a id="Page_205" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[205]"></a> the story must be brief, because the adventure was no more than an ordinary occurrence, where neither glory nor honor is to be won, nor great deeds accomplished.</p>
<p>At midnight, eight and forty hours after the news had been brought, General Marion's brigade descended upon Colonel Tynes' camp, and simply overran it.</p>
<p>It seems strange even now that we should have seized upon all that store, throwing so many well-armed men into a panic by simply riding among them, yet such is the fact.</p>
<p>When, in the darkness of the night, the brigade came upon the encampment, we four comrades were sent forward to reconnoiter, and true it is that we failed to find a single sentinel on guard. In some of the camps men were playing cards, in others they slept, and yet more sat around the camp-fires, drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>The officers were making merry in a building hard by, and there were none to oppose our progress. <a id="Page_206" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[206]"></a></p>
<p>The reconnaissance was attended with as little danger as if we four had gone out sight-seeing among friends, and when we returned to where General Marion and my uncle the major, awaited our coming, it was with a story so incredible that for an instant they could hardly believe our statements.</p>
<p>Then the word "Forward" was given, and we, as I have said, overran that camp without hindrance.</p>
<p>Neither Britisher nor Tory so much as discharged a gun; the redcoat and renegade Carolinian alike sought refuge in flight, hoping to gain the fastness of Tarcote Swamp, and to have cut them down in their panic would have been like murdering men in cold blood, for how can you take the life of him who offers no resistance?</p>
<p>Twenty minutes had not elapsed from the time we made our report, until the encampment with all its wealth of British stores was our own, and here and there <a id="Page_207" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[207]"></a> came some scurvy Tory crawling and cringing before our officers as he begged to be allowed the privilege of enlisting.</p>
<p>It was not warfare; but simply a foraging expedition among people who were the same as unarmed.</p>
<p>Colonel Tynes, two of his captains, and fifty-four British regulars were taken prisoners. We hardly troubled ourselves about the Tories, save that Gavin, Percy, Gabriel and I rode here and there searching eagerly for Sam Lee, but finding him not.</p>
<p>When day broke our men overhauled the equipments and the provisions which were intended for those who should take up arms against us, and before we gave heed to breaking our fast the old and patched saddles were replaced by new ones of English make; our powder-horns and shot-pouches were filled; we wore breeches and boots that had been brought for the benefit of our enemies, and, to a man, were as well equipped as any force the butcher Tarleton ever headed. <a id="Page_208" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[208]"></a></p>
<p>The prisoners were sent to Kingstree, which town we now believed ourselves capable of holding, and in the fourth encampment that had been wrested from the Britishers or their allies, we feasted and made merry, Gabriel declaring that he was "disappointed in having thus joined a band of foragers when he expected to see somewhat of warfare."</p>
<p>And the poor lad did see warfare in its most bitter phase before many days passed.</p>
<p>Now that I am come to the closing acts in this life which we knew for so short a time and loved so well, I must hasten over them because of the bitterness which comes to me with the memory that has never faded.</p>
<p>We three comrades—meaning Gavin, Percy and myself—had seen the darkest days of the struggle, and then suddenly participated in the joy which came to us when, seemingly without good reason, we were once more triumphant. <a id="Page_209" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[209]"></a></p>
<p>Gabriel had come at the moment when we were flushed with the excitement of unexpected success, and he saw but little of it, poor lad!</p>
<p>While we lay at Salem receiving every day new recruits from those who had been lukewarm to the Cause, and from the cowards who believed safety lay only in friendship with the "rebels," word was brought that Lord Cornwallis had begged Colonel Tarleton to "get at" General Marion.</p>
<p>It was said that the butcher had arisen from a bed of sickness brought about by his own excesses, with a vow that he would capture "the scurvy Swamp Fox," and that his Legion, which was before Camden, had orders to meet him on the Wateree River, from which place he would set out to make a prisoner of our general.</p>
<p>This information came to us at a time when we were not only ready, but willing, to meet the infamous Tarleton, although <a id="Page_210" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[210]"></a> in his Legion were two men, where there was one of ours, and, as my uncle said with a grim smile, when speaking to Gavin Witherspoon after orders had been given us to prepare for the march, "we would make Colonel Tarleton's mission as easy of accomplishment as was possible, so far as showing him the whereabouts of the Swamp Fox was concerned."</p>
<p>Our horses were in good condition; every man among us eager to measure strength with this human brute who had devastated the Carolinas wherever he marched, and we hardly drew rein until arriving once more at Nelson's Ferry, on the Santee River.</p>
<p>This was the second time we had crossed the entire district of Williamsburg with a swiftness such as astounded the British horsemen, and it is little wonder that our general received from them the name in which we of his brigade gloried.</p>
<p>Exactly how strong the Britishers were there was no means of knowing, although <a id="Page_211" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[211]"></a> one might guess that Tarleton would not come out with less than his full legion, which numbered upwards of eleven hundred men; but yet we pressed forward even after having come upon their trail, and knowing how much greater their force was than ours—pressed forward close upon their heels until the hour came when it would have been folly to continue on, because the horses were winded.</p>
<p>Then we made camp in the woods, Gabriel Marion complaining bitterly because his uncle had called a halt, although the steed the lad bestrode could not have advanced five miles more at an ordinary pace.</p>
<p>Near the enemy, as we knew ourselves to be, it was necessary to take every precaution at this encampment, and we were yet hard at work while our steeds were feeding, throwing up such rude shelters as would suffice for the use of the sharp-shooters, when Colonel Richardson, who served under General Sumter until <a id="Page_212" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[212]"></a> wounded and had then retired to his plantation for a time, came into camp.</p>
<p>Percy and I were acting as sentinels when he first arrived, and, fearing some treachery, for he was a stranger to us, would have prevented him from even speaking with one of our officers, had he not referred to his services under our father's brother with such minuteness of detail that we could not longer remain incredulous.</p>
<p>I conducted him to where General Marion and Major James sat upon the ground amid a clump of bushes discussing plans for the next day's work, and had hardly more than saluted when a great light flashed up on the western sky.</p>
<p>"It is the flames of my dwelling," Colonel Richardson exclaimed bitterly, even before the general and the major had time to welcome him. "Tarleton's Legion is within five miles, bent now as ever upon their work of devastation!"</p>
<p>"And you have fled at such a time?" <a id="Page_213" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[213]"></a> my uncle, the major, said, in a tone very nearly that of reproach.</p>
<p>"I would willingly have given up my life in defense of those whom I love; but that you are in the greatest danger. Hidden with my wife and children in one of the outbuildings—no other able-bodied man on the plantation to aid me in a defense which would have been vain—I saw a lad, whom I believe to be one of the Tory Lees from nearabout Kingstree, ride up and demand audience of Tarleton. So near was the butcher to me at the moment that I heard plainly the young scoundrel's speech, and it was to the effect that General Marion with his brigade lay here at this place. There was no longer any course left me save to give you warning, for as soon as my plantation has been ruined and the butcher satisfies himself I am not at hand to be hanged, he will make a descent upon you."</p>
<p>"We have come to give him that opportunity," my uncle, the major, said proudly, <a id="Page_214" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[214]"></a> whereat Colonel Richardson showed signs of great alarm.</p>
<p>"You can easily be surrounded here, and, with a force such as Tarleton has, must be cut to pieces, however bravely your men may fight. To make a stand would be useless sacrifice of life, and I conjure you, General Marion, that you seek a more advantageous place in which to meet the enemy; but whatsoever may be your decision, I here offer myself as a recruit until you shall have given the British cutthroat a proper lesson." <a id="Page_215" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[215]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00012">CHAPTER X.<br/>
<span class="s08">GEORGETOWN.</span></h2>
<p>The information which Colonel Richardson brought regarding the renegade who had acquainted Tarleton with General Marion's whereabouts, fired us four comrades to such a degree that right willingly would we have pushed forward alone in the hope of taking him prisoner, even while surrounded by his British friends.</p>
<p>As has already been set down, we gave Sam Lee credit for doing whatsoever was in his power against us, but, while it was no surprise that he should have continued making every effort to work harm to the friends of freedom, there was mingled with our righteous anger something of astonishment at his success.</p>
<p>He might have lived twice the ordinary <a id="Page_216" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[216]"></a> lifetime of a man without being able to do as much mischief as in this case, when our people were making ready to fall suddenly upon Tarleton's forces.</p>
<p>Now, however, that was impossible. Even Major James realized that, instead of pushing on, we must beat a retreat once more, and without loss of time.</p>
<p>From this moment until that sad hour when Gavin, Percy and myself, to say nothing of the general, were so sorely afflicted, there is nothing of particular moment to write, except that I set down the different movements made by our brigade, and the situation of affairs in the Carolinas.</p>
<p>In less than twenty minutes from the time Colonel Richardson came into the encampment, were we urging our jaded steeds through that gloomy swamp known as the "wood-yard," and two hours later the command was halted on Jack's Creek.</p>
<p>We had covered only six miles in all that time, owing to the condition of the horses; <a id="Page_217" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[217]"></a> but it was sufficient, so far as eluding the Britishers was concerned, because they might not find us unless, perchance, more spies were lurking around, until after the day should break.</p>
<p>While Colonel Tarleton was a butcher—a man who had no idea of mercy or compassion, it is only just to give him the credit of being a good soldier after his own particular fashion.</p>
<p>As a man to lead rough-riders, he was perhaps the best in the king's service, and we who were fleeing before him understood that not a single moment would be lost in the pursuit. Ride as fast and as constantly as we might, his men would be ever on our heels, so long as they could hold the pace, and it was endurance and the speed of the horses which should give the final result.</p>
<p>At daybreak our brigade was on the march once more, making its way over bogs and through swamps until it was arrived at Benbow's Ferry, about ten miles <a id="Page_218" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[218]"></a> above Kingstree, where was a strong natural camp.</p>
<p>It was a place with which we were all familiar. It commanded a passage of the river, and was within easy riding distance of all the country roundabout from which we must draw provisions and provender. As a rallying point it could not have been equalled in the Carolinas, and should we be hard pressed there were three difficult passes through the swamp in the rear where, if necessary, we might make a stubborn fight.</p>
<p>Strong as was this position, General Marion set about strengthening it yet further.</p>
<p>Trees were felled, breastworks put up, and in eight and forty hours we were prepared to meet Tarleton's much-vaunted legion, reasoning that our defenses made up for lack of numbers until we were fully the enemy's equal.</p>
<p>Now we believed that a decisive battle would soon be fought—one in which the victory could not be doubtful, but where <a id="Page_219" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[219]"></a> the conquerors might for a certain length of time hold undisputed possession of the Williamsburg district, and we counted on being those conquerors.</p>
<p>It was not destined, however, that the struggle in the Carolinas should be brought to so speedy a conclusion.</p>
<p>Tarleton pursued our brigade, losing time here and there to burn dwellings which sheltered only women and children, until he was come to within less than twelve miles of our camp, when, to the surprise of enemies as well as friends, he turned suddenly about and marched with all speed for Camden.</p>
<p>It was afterward said by the Tories that Lord Cornwallis had expressly ordered him to return; but more than one of us believed then, and yet hold to it, that the redcoated Britisher who could be so courageous when he had none but old men, boys and women in front of him, was absolutely afraid to measure strength with General Marion. <a id="Page_220" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[220]"></a></p>
<p>Now while we laid here in safety, gathering numbers every day, much was done by our friends in other parts of the colony.</p>
<p>General Sumter, our kinsman, gave battle to Tarleton at the Blackstock farm on the banks of the Tyger, defeating him utterly, but at a terrific loss, so far as the Cause was concerned. The Britishers had ninety-two killed and one hundred and four wounded. Among the Americans only three were slain and four wounded; but in the latter list was the general himself, who bore as marks of the victory a severely dangerous wound in the breast.</p>
<p>His gallant followers, true to him as was our brigade to General Marion, lashed him in the raw hide of a bullock which was slung as a litter between two horses, and thus, guarded by an hundred picked men, he was carried to the upper colony, so we were told, where he lay hovering 'twixt life and death.</p>
<p>It was also while we were encamped <a id="Page_221" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[221]"></a> here that the battle of King's Mountain was fought, when the British, under Major Ferguson, were defeated handsomely, the killed, wounded and captured of the enemy amounting to eleven hundred men, and among the dead was the major himself.</p>
<p>Two exceedingly fortunate encounters for us—encounters such as guaranteed to us final victory if we could but hold out as we had begun, and this seemed most probable, for, as ever will be the case, a successful commander finds plenty of recruits.</p>
<p>We of Williamsburg were not inactive during the days spent in camp; but made forays here and there, capturing in some places bands of Tories on their way to Georgetown, or, having the good fortune to come across detachments of the redcoats who were guarding store-trains, until, should I attempt to repeat all the little adventures which befell us, I might continue this writing until so many pages <a id="Page_222" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[222]"></a> were filled that one would shrink from the reading because of the magnitude of the task.</p>
<p>It is with the more adventurous, but yet the sadder part of our service under General Marion that I must close this record which has been intended only to show what we comrades did, up to the time Snow's Island was fortified, when we ceased active operations during the year.</p>
<p>The British post at Georgetown was the one place which our people most needed as a base of operations against Charleston, and, in fact, to hold our own in Williamsburg district.</p>
<p>Situated as it was, we were constantly menaced, wherever our brigade might be, by the enemy holding possession of the place. In addition to that, it was a depot for supplies of salt, clothing and ammunition for the king's troops, and of such goods, we who fought for the Cause were grievously in need.</p>
<p>To capture Georgetown would be an exploit <a id="Page_223" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[223]"></a> such as might advantage our people more than had the victory at King's Mountain, therefore it was to this end that our general proposed to bend all his energies, and in the proposition he was seconded ably by such followers as Major James and Colonel Richardson, the last-named gentleman having remained with us since the day his home was destroyed.</p>
<p>It was believed that the enemy lay at Georgetown in great force, perhaps to the number of four thousand men, and we knew full well the nature of the fortifications round about the post.</p>
<p>A direct assault would have been fatal to us. It was only by such methods as had won for our general the name of "Swamp Fox," that we could succeed, and, as can well be fancied, none of our people were averse to an attempt under those circumstances, for we believed ourselves, so far as backwoods strategy was concerned, far superior to any of the king's forces.</p>
<p>The first we of the rank and file knew, <a id="Page_224" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[224]"></a> regarding the method by which it was hoped we might succeed, was when we broke camp, carrying with us all our equipage and so much of provisions as could be gathered from the country round about, and crossed Black River to a little settlement known as Potato Ferry, advancing toward Georgetown by that road called the "Gap Way."</p>
<p>Now this much by way of explanation for the benefit of those who are not acquainted with the vicinity of that post.</p>
<p>Three miles from Georgetown is an inland swamp known as White's Bay, which, discharging itself by two mouths, the one into Black River and the other into Sampit, completely cuts off the post, which stands on the north side of the last-named river near its junction with Winyaw Bay. Over the creek which empties into Sampit there is a bridge, two miles from the town.</p>
<p>Now it was in the rear of this swamp that we finally came to a halt, having, as <a id="Page_225" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[225]"></a> was believed, arrived there without knowledge of the enemy.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon claimed that he understood all which the general proposed to do, but that statement I question seriously, otherwise would we have heard from the old man concerning several moves that would have been more than injudicious if General Marion had the same idea in mind Gavin gave him credit for.</p>
<p>Let it be understood that we were come to this point, not more than three miles from the post, five hundred and fifty strong, each one mounted and carrying so much of provisions and provender as would suffice for eight and forty hours' consumption.</p>
<p>Up to the moment of our halting we had seen no persons save those whom we knew beyond a peradventure to be devoted to the Cause, and, therefore, could say to a certainty that we were thus far advanced toward the object of our desires in such fashion as the Swamp Fox most desired. <a id="Page_226" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[226]"></a></p>
<p>Unless some false move was made, some prying, unfriendly eye discovered us, we would be able to ride down upon Georgetown as we had ridden into many a British camp before, doing more through fear than bullets, and gaining victory where by rights none should have been enjoyed.</p>
<p>Well, we were halted here, and all had dismounted, each man feeding his horse in anticipation of the work to come when the speed of the animals would avail as much, perhaps even more than the accuracy of our aim.</p>
<p>Then it was, after a consultation with the general, my uncle advanced where all, save that line of sentinels which hemmed us in to keep prying eyes at a respectful distance, might see him, and Gabriel Marion said to me gleefully:</p>
<p>"Now has come the time, lad, when we will be able to ride into this adventure side by side, and carve out for ourselves such names as shall live in the grateful memory of men after these colonies are free." <a id="Page_227" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[227]"></a></p>
<p>And the dear lad did carve out a name for himself!</p>
<p>"I call for volunteers who will present themselves for dangerous service," my uncle began, and every man pricked up his ears, each eager to be among those who might distinguish themselves. "Two squads of twenty each, and so many as are minded to sacrifice their lives, perchance, for the benefit of the brigade, may step forward two paces."</p>
<p>Gavin, Percy, Gabriel and I advanced without loss of time, and the blood fairly leaped in my veins when I saw that of all the brigade every man had made the same movement.</p>
<p>In General Marion's force each was equally eager to lay down his life for the others, and it was that spirit which finally gained for us the independence of the American colonies.</p>
<p>"I had expected some such outburst of patriotism; but failed by a considerable degree to anticipate the reality," my uncle, <a id="Page_228" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[228]"></a> the major, said with a smile of satisfaction. "You be brave lads all, as has been proven many and many a time before, and therefore each and every one is entitled to the honor of making his life the sacrifice for the others; but, unfortunately for your desires, only forty men may be chosen. Let those who are willing to relinquish the desire to show their love for country in order that others who, perhaps, can better be spared may make any sacrifice, retreat two paces."</p>
<p>Not a man moved; every trooper of the Williamsburg brigade stood firm in place, as if determined that he, and he alone, should be the one who would give up his life for the other, and among them all were we four comrades, tried and true—comrades who were destined to ride on until we saw one of our number fall, foully murdered, without being able to raise a hand in his defense.</p>
<p>Now it was that General Marion advanced to the side of my uncle, his eyes all <a id="Page_229" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[229]"></a> aflame, and more enthusiasm showing in that quiet face than I had ever believed could find a place there.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the Williamsburg brigade, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Many a time before have you proven yourselves heroes; but never so truly, never so emphatically as at this moment—when every man of you is eager to offer up his life, and in that for which the volunteers are called I do assure you there are eight chances out of ten that no one comes back alive. Now I entreat that so many of you as are fathers of families shall step back, allowing younger soldiers to take your places."</p>
<p>Yet every man remained in his place, and it seemed much as though we might come at loggerheads, one with the other, as to who should die first, for all knew that this attack upon the well-fortified, over-garrisoned post of Georgetown was no child's play, no feint at warfare; but a desperate undertaking which to succeed <a id="Page_230" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[230]"></a> must be carried on with total disregard of life.</p>
<p>"Now has come the time when I myself must make the selection," the major, my uncle, said with a look on his face which told how greatly this exhibition pleased him. "I shall call out one man, and the general may select another, each making his choice until the forty have been chosen. Let it be remembered that in this case I exercise the right to use favoritism, for there be among you lads of my own blood whom I am minded shall go forth in preference to those who have families dependent upon them. Therefore, men, do not blame me when I claim what I <i>may</i> claim, even disregarding the privilege of others."</p>
<p>Then it was, and proud am I to write it, that he cried out:</p>
<p>"Robert Sumter!"</p>
<p>I stepped forward, my face flushed with pardonable pride, and in his turn the general cried:</p>
<p>"Gabriel Marion!" <a id="Page_231" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[231]"></a></p>
<p>"Percy Sumter!" my uncle next called, and the general added:</p>
<p>"Gavin Witherspoon!"</p>
<p>Thus were we four comrades the first to be selected for this post of honor which will be remembered, as I fondly believe, long after we are gone from this world, and in all the Carolinas were no four individuals more puffed up with pride and pleasure than we.</p>
<p>Around us everywhere were envious eyes, as if life had suddenly lost all its charm, and death were the one thing most desired.</p>
<p>Man after man was thus summoned to take his place in the ranks of the devoted, until we had the full number two paces in advance of all the rest, and then it was my uncle said, moving up and down the line as if it pleasured him to look on those who were selected for the most perilous venture:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, it may be that after another hour has passed we shall not meet again on this earth. Therefore I pray you, <a id="Page_232" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[232]"></a> those who have any request to make, speak now, that we may remember in the days to come that all you desired was granted."</p>
<p>No man spoke for so long a time as would have taken me to count twenty, and then Gabriel Marion, dear lad that he was, raised his cap courteously, as he bowed and said:</p>
<p>"Major James, if it so be the request we make now be granted, I pray your pardon when I ask a selfish one, which is that us four who have been comrades since I joined the brigade—us four who have eaten and slept together, may not be separated when you shall divide this squad into two. That we may be allowed to go on side by side, as we have from the day I first knew these lads and Gavin Witherspoon."</p>
<p>"It shall be as you say," my uncle replied, and then turning, looked at the others.</p>
<p>Emboldened by Gabriel's speech, one man requested that should he fail to return, evidence might be sent his kinsmen that <a id="Page_233" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[233]"></a> he was proud at being able to thus serve the colonies.</p>
<p>Another made a similar request, and so on until perhaps half a dozen had spoken, when all fell silent.</p>
<p>There was no more to be said. It only remained that we march forth to lay down our lives, or to win them, as the case might be.</p>
<p>As for myself, I believed we who were chosen would probably perish in whatsoever of adventure was before us, for I thought then, much as did Gavin Witherspoon, that we were to make an attack upon two portions of the town, while the remainder of the brigade, after we were slain, would come in a different direction, and, taking advantage of the diversion caused by our attack, win the day.</p>
<p>It would be a glorious ending of one's life; yet as I reflected upon it, although not in the least degree wishing I might have been among this third party rather than in the lead, I said to myself that it would <a id="Page_234" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[234]"></a> be sweet to live until we had thrown off the king's yoke, for at this moment when we stood face to face with death, almost feeling the great white angel's cold hand upon us, I was as certain we would finally win the victory, however many hirelings his majesty might send upon us, as I was certain that my life might within a very few moments be the penalty of the pride which was within me.</p>
<p>Perchance never in the history of the Carolinas has there at any one time so much of true bravery been shown as we saw then when the only discontent was because one was more favored than another in the permission to offer his life as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Well, we were not kept long in line after such arrangements had been made as I have described.</p>
<p>Before being dismissed, however, those who were to be left behind would have raised a cheer, but that Captain Horry prevented any such outburst lest scouting <a id="Page_235" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[235]"></a> parties of the enemy might be near, and then the final preparations were made without loss of time for the work in hand.</p>
<p>Captain Melton was named as the gentleman who should lead our squad, and Captain Horry given command of the other.</p>
<p>So far as his purpose was concerned, General Marion did not leave us in doubt, claiming, as he said, that we had the right to know exactly what he proposed doing so we might act the more intelligently.</p>
<p>Our squad was to approach the town near White's Bridge, and the other would reconnoiter on the opposite side of the post; but neither was to return, save in case of some serious disaster, until the main attack had been made.</p>
<p>It was not exactly as Gavin Witherspoon had predicted, because we were given no orders to assault the enemy independently; but were to make a detour, each squad half around the post, and in case of any important discovery to send word back immediately to the general. <a id="Page_236" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[236]"></a></p>
<p>At the dawn of the following day the brigade was to advance, and at the first alarm, wherever we of the chosen ones might be, we would join the assaulting party in such manner as our commanders thought proper.</p>
<p>All this, as I have said, was told by General Marion himself, and nothing could have given us greater confidence in the adventure than that he should see fit to explain his plans when another commander might have remained silent.</p>
<p>There were no leave-takings; no delay.</p>
<p>Such work as ours was to be done on the instant, and Captain Melton, advancing at the head of our squad, for by this time we had been told off in two parties of twenty, said quietly:</p>
<p>"We will move on foot in such formation as may be most agreeable. As I understand it, our work is rather in the nature of spying than of a military movement, and my only order is that you allow me to lead." <a id="Page_237" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[237]"></a></p>
<p>Captain Horry was already leaving the encampment when we set off, following our commander much as a party of pleasure seekers might troop after him who had promised to show them some desirable place of entertainment, and as we threaded our way through the swamp Gabriel Marion, linking his arm in mine, said cheerily, with never a tremor in his voice to show that the doom of the future lay upon his heart:</p>
<p>"We four are in rare luck, Robert Sumter. I did not believe my uncle would grant me so great a boon as to call my name, and when yours was spoken by Major James the tears almost came into my eyes, fearing lest you should go while I remained behind." <a id="Page_238" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[238]"></a></p>
<h2 id="pgepubid00013">CHAPTER XI.<br/>
<span class="s08">GABRIEL.</span></h2>
<p>I know not how to set down properly such a narrative as this, and, therefore, should be excused for such mistakes as may occur through ignorance and inexperience.</p>
<p>It is with the attack upon Georgetown that I must end this portion of the adventures which befell Percy and myself during the time we served under General Marion, and it may be the story should be continued straight on without any heed whatsoever to those who fought with us, although in the same squad.</p>
<p>Whether it be right or wrong, I cannot well neglect to speak of the part played by that other party of twenty who volunteered their lives as eagerly as did we who followed Captain Melton, and what I write <a id="Page_239" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[239]"></a> concerning them must, of course, be from hearsay.</p>
<p>Therefore it seems to me proper to tell first the story of Colonel Horry's squad, as I have heard it related again and again, before attempting to set down that which I know of my own knowledge.</p>
<p>When the forty volunteers were divided into two squads there was no time lost, as I have already said, in setting forward upon that mission which we believed could be fully accomplished only through the sacrifice of us all, and we parted at the limits of the temporary halting place, Captain Melton leading his force to the right, while Colonel Horry began the reconnoiter by bearing to the left.</p>
<p>As to what befell the first squad, this is as I have heard it related:</p>
<p>They continued on through the woods until near to daybreak, when, as Colonel Horry himself has said, and I am now quoting from his official account, he "laid an ambuscade, with my twenty men, near <a id="Page_240" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[240]"></a> the road. About sunrise a chair appeared with two ladies escorted by two British officers. I was ready in advance with an officer to cut them off, but reflecting that they might escape, and alarm the town, which would prevent my taking greater numbers, I desisted. The officers and chair halted very near me, but soon the chair went on, and the officers galloped into the town. Our party continued in ambush until 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>"Nothing appearing, and we having eaten nothing for many hours, retired to a plantation not far distant, where I knew were to be found friends. As soon as I entered the house four ladies appeared, two of whom were Mrs. White and her daughter. I was asked what I wanted. I answered, food, refreshment. The other two ladies were those whom I had seen escorted by the British officers.</p>
<p>"The strange ladies seemed greatly agitated, and begged most earnestly that I would go away. I kept my eye on Mrs. <a id="Page_241" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[241]"></a> White, and saw she had a smiling countenance, but said nothing. Soon she left the room, and I left it also and went into the piazza, laid my cap, sword and pistols on the long bench, and walked the piazza; when I discovered Mrs. White behind the house chimney beckoning me.</p>
<p>"I got to her undiscovered by the young ladies, when she said: 'Colonel Horry, be on your guard; these two young ladies are just from Georgetown; they are much frightened, and I believe the British are leaving it and may soon attack you. As to provisions, I have plenty in yonder barn, but you must affect to take them by force.'</p>
<p>"I begged her to say no more, for I was well acquainted with all such matters. We both secretly returned, she to the room where the young ladies were, and I to the piazza I had just left."</p>
<p>The colonel had no more than gained this point, when the sentinels gave an alarm. <a id="Page_242" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[242]"></a></p>
<p>Two musket-shots told him that an enemy was near at hand, and almost immediately afterward the firing became so rapid that he knew an encounter was already begun.</p>
<p>That brave officer thought only of his men, and so nearly were the interests of the squad allied, that he forgot all else save the desire to be with them in the time of danger.</p>
<p>He rushed into the fight, forgetting to take with him even his saber—intent only on being with those who had so well proven their devotion to the Cause.</p>
<p>The British were seventeen in number, well armed, and commanded by a brave fellow named Merritt; but they were taken by surprise.</p>
<p>The redcoats retreated, but turned in their flight to strike a blow, and our men, believing they had been ordered on even to death, pursued with fatal earnestness.</p>
<p>Of the enemy's force only two men escaped death or capture, and one of these <a id="Page_243" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[243]"></a> was the captain, of whom Colonel Horry writes:</p>
<p>"My men in succession came up with Captain Merritt, who was in the rear of his party, urging them forward. They engaged him. He was a brave fellow. Baxter, with pistols, fired at his breast, and missing him, retired; Postell and Greene, with swords, engaged him; both were beaten off. Greene nearly lost his head. His buckskin breeches were cut through several inches. I almost blush to say that this one British officer beat off three Americans. Merritt escaped to a neighboring swamp, from whence, at midnight, he got to Georgetown."</p>
<p>I would it were possible for me to give as brief an account, with as satisfactory an ending, regarding our portion of the reconnoiter.</p>
<p>As has been said, after crossing White's Bridge the two squads separated, Colonel Horry's going toward the left and ours to the right. <a id="Page_244" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[244]"></a></p>
<p>Then it was, as we rode on slowly, mentally nerved for anything which might happen and fully expecting sharp and bloody work at any instant, that Gabriel Marion said, looking first at Percy and then at me:</p>
<p>"Perhaps it will never again be our good fortune, comrades, to have such an opportunity of proving our metal as has come to us this night. Now I am in nowise eager for death; but to my mind there is little fear that the end be near at hand. Although the odds are so strongly against us, we shall take this post of Georgetown, and I believe it because my uncle, the major, is a careful, prudent soldier, never taking upon himself chances that are utterly without hope, although many times the fact may have seemed to be the reverse. We shall capture Georgetown, comrades, and if either of us fails to come out alive, we have the proud satisfaction of knowing that whatsoever befalls the Cause our names must live among <a id="Page_245" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[245]"></a> those who volunteered everything for freedom."</p>
<p>"I hold to it that this is not the time for such speeches," Gavin Witherspoon said nervously; and had I not known him to be a man of tried courage I should have said that at that moment he was afraid. "These forty men who came forward so gallantly understood full well in what kind of an adventure they were engaged. It does not prove that his courage is the greatest who speaks overly much regarding the future."</p>
<p>"Meaning by such speech, that I had best hold my tongue," Gabriel said with a laugh. "Perhaps you may be right, and yet there is upon me the inclination to speak of what we have ventured, in order that I may be the better able to appreciate life after it has been offered as a sacrifice and refused."</p>
<p>"I guarantee that once we are come out from this expedition, you will need no thought of the past to make you understand <a id="Page_246" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[246]"></a> that we rode down the very shadow of death, when we crossed yonder bridge, and this I say, not because there is in my mind any foreknowledge of the future, but from what I know regarding the enemy. I realize, without being told, that ours is as desperate an undertaking as men can well imagine."</p>
<p>"I am thinking that your words, Gavin Witherspoon, are as ill-timed as were Gabriel's, for while he spoke of what might be our reward, you are weighing, as it were, the chances against us, and to my mind it is not pleasant," Percy said with an attempt at cheerfulness which I knew full well was forced, and, stepping nearer to the lad, I grasped his hand, an act which, perhaps, gave him as much encouragement as was in my mind to impart.</p>
<p>Gabriel continued to speak of the future, as if he had no part in the present, until word came that each man must hold himself silent because we were come so near <a id="Page_247" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[247]"></a> the town that there was good reason for believing the enemy's sentinels might be close at hand.</p>
<p>We straggled on, each as he pleased, although there was some little show of military formation. Captain Melton was allowed to remain in the lead as he had stipulated, but we four comrades took good care not to fall back more than two or three paces, for we were minded to bear the brunt of the first encounter.</p>
<p>I had never before known what it was to advance against an enemy on foot, and the fact of being without a horse gave me a certain sense of uneasiness.</p>
<p>So far as we of these two advanced squads were concerned, there could be no sudden dash; no spurring forward into the very midst of the enemy. We must fight our way forward slowly, and, as it seemed to me, at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, it is true that my courage did not fail me, although my hand trembled with excitement, and my mouth was <a id="Page_248" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[248]"></a> parched and dry as if I had been many hours without water.</p>
<p>Gabriel had just thrown his arm over my shoulder, to show the affection which was in his heart for us all, when the thud of horses' hoofs directly in the front told that the enemy were on the alert.</p>
<p>Instantly we were halted, every man in a posture of defense, and I venture to say that there was not one among us who did not wish he was in the saddle.</p>
<p>"Hold steady, boys!" Captain Melton whispered. "Yonder comes the patrol, and it may be they will turn before coming as far as this; but if not, we have our work cut out for us. The enemy must not pass this point lest our friends in the rear be discovered!"</p>
<p>Involuntarily we four had crouched upon our knees in such position that we could use the muskets to good advantage, and thus we remained in the front line while the horsemen galloped nearer and nearer until they were absolutely upon us. <a id="Page_249" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[249]"></a></p>
<p>"Fire!" our commander shouted, and from that little squad of crouching figures a line of fire flashed forth into the very nostrils of the animals, causing them to rear and plunge madly, thus diverting our bullets from their targets.</p>
<p>Three saddles were emptied when a full twenty would have been the result of the volley had we fired one minute before, and then every man among us began to reload his weapon with feverish haste, for but few seconds could elapse before the Britishers would charge.</p>
<p>"This is what may be called a real battle!" Gabriel cried exultantly; but no one replied.</p>
<p>Death for many of us was close at hand, and at such a time words do not come readily.</p>
<p>I was ramming home the bullet in my musket when the horsemen again dashed upon us from out the darkness; there came a roar as if a thousand guns had been discharged at the same instant, and <a id="Page_250" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[250]"></a> all before me seemed to be a sheet of flame.</p>
<p>Of what followed during the next five or ten minutes I have no clear idea.</p>
<p>Before me reared and plunged the British horses, while here, there and everywhere I heard cries of rage or groans of mortal agony until it was all a hideous, whirling, dancing picture in which I could distinguish only the outlines of my comrades, who held their places bravely.</p>
<p>Side by side we fought against the redcoats, ignorant of the fact that we were alone, and then came the moment when all our muskets were emptied at the same instant.</p>
<p>The horsemen surrounded us; our weapons were of little service against the sabers of the enemy, and we understood it, although there was no thought of surrender in my mind until Gavin Witherspoon seized me by the arm, shouting in my ear:</p>
<p>"Surrender, lad, surrender! There is <a id="Page_251" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[251]"></a> neither honor nor glory in dying when our lives are of no avail for the Cause!"</p>
