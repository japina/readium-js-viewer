</div>
<p>Even as he spoke three of the redcoats had clutched Gabriel and Percy.</p>
<p>I allowed my musket, which had been raised as a club, to drop, and immediately I felt, for the first time, the grasp of a Britisher.</p>
<p>We were prisoners. The glory of fighting to the bitter end with the knowledge that in so doing we were opening the way for those in the rear, was denied us, and but for the shame of it I could have wept like a girl.</p>
<p>And yet all this was as nothing compared with what followed.</p>
<p>The troopers were about to disarm us, and some one had fired a torch that we might be the better seen, when Sam Lee—that miserable Tory and renegade—came up from the rear, where most likely he had been skulking during the fighting, and, seeing us, set up a shout of triumph. <a id="Page_252" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[252]"></a></p>
<p>"Now have I got you rebels where I've been burning to see you?" he cried.</p>
<p>"Now we shall see—"</p>
<p>"Is that Sam Lee?" Gabriel shouted, struggling to release himself from his captor's grasp.</p>
<p>"Ay, and it is the cur who has sold his country, his kinsmen and himself for the king's gold!" Percy replied. "There is no dishonor in being overpowered by true soldiers in a fair fight; but to have such as that villain alive before one's eyes is a disgrace."</p>
<p>"It shall be worse than that to you!" Sam shrieked, "and as for that nephew of the rebel Marion, I—"</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" one of the troopers asked, seizing Sam Lee and shaking him as if to force the reply more quickly. "Is one of these a nephew to the Swamp Fox?"</p>
<p>"Ay, that he is!" Gabriel made answer, stepping forward as far as the hand of the captor would permit. "I am the <a id="Page_253" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[253]"></a> nephew of General Marion, and proud indeed of the kinship!"</p>
<p>I was looking at the dear lad that instant, having turned my eyes from the scurvy Tory when Gabriel began to speak, otherwise, perhaps, I might have prevented that terrible thing which followed.</p>
<p>While the remainder of the party were looking at the brave lad who stood before them in the glare of the torches, Sam Lee, doubled-dyed villain that he was, rushed upon him with a saber which he had seized from the hand of the trooper.</p>
<p>In the flickering light I saw the gleam of the steel, and before a word of warning could escape my lips, the cruel weapon descended, striking Gabriel full upon the head, sheering its way downward until the dear lad sank a lifeless mass at the feet of that cur who was not worthy to so much as kneel before him.</p>
<p>On the instant it was as if my eyes were blinded by the crimson flood that followed the stroke of the blade. There was a sensation <a id="Page_254" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[254]"></a> as if all my blood was boiling, and, for the time being, reason left me.</p>
<p>Gavin Witherspoon declares that I wrenched myself free from the trooper who held me, as if the Britisher had been no more than a babe, that at the same instant I leaped upon the Tory murderer, bearing him to the earth till his face was sunk deep in the blood-stained moss, and with the same weapon which had let out the life of the most gallant lad who ever lived, I killed him.</p>
<p>It was done so quickly, Gavin declares, that the redcoats had no time to interfere before the work was accomplished, and while they, horror-stricken as it were by that which was not warfare in any sense of the word, stood before us three—two dead and one senseless, the remainder of our squad fell upon them.</p>
<p>This last attack was successful; the Britishers were beaten off, and our brave fellows carried Gabriel's dear body, and myself, back to the rear. <a id="Page_255" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[255]"></a></p>
<p>The attempt to capture Georgetown was a failure, now that the enemy had been warned, and our brigade beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>Of all that I know nothing; it was many days before my senses returned, and then we were encamped on Snow's Island.</p>
<p>It is best that I add to my story what has been written by one who is a master hand at wielding a pen, while I am only a novice, and that I bring this portion of the adventures which befell Percy Sumter and myself to an end, with the promise to write out at some later day what we two did when the work of the patriots was finally crowned with success.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"The murder of Gabriel Marion, with some other instances of brutality and butchery on the part of the Tories, happening about this time, gave a more savage character than ever to the warfare which ensued. Motives of private anger and personal <a id="Page_256" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[256]"></a> revenge embittered and increased the usual ferocities of civil war; and hundreds of dreadful and desperate tragedies caused the inhabitants to pursue each other rather like wild beasts than like men.</p>
<p>"In the Cheraw district, on the Pedee, above the line where Marion commanded, the warfare was one of utter extermination. The revolutionary struggle in Carolina was of a sort unknown in any other part of the Union.</p>
<p>"The attempt upon Georgetown was defeated. The British had taken the alarm, and were now in strength, and in a state of vigilance and activity which precluded the possibility of surprise. Marion's wishes, therefore, with regard to this place, were deferred accordingly to a more auspicious season.</p>
<p>"He retired to Snow's Island, where he made his camp. It was peculiarly eligible for his purposes, furnishing a secure retreat, a depot for his arms, ammunition, <a id="Page_257" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[257]"></a> prisoners and invalids—difficult of access, easily guarded, and contiguous to the scenes of his most active operations.</p>
<p>"Snow's Island lies at the confluence of Lynch's Creek and the Pedee. On the east flows the latter river; on the west, Clark's Creek, issuing from Lynch's and a stream navigable for small vessels; on the north lies Lynch's Creek, wide and deep, but nearly choked by rafts of logs and refuse timber. The island, high river swamp, was spacious, and, like all the Pedee river swamp of that day, abounded in live stock and provision. Thick woods covered the elevated tracts, dense cane-brakes the lower, and here and there the eye rested upon a cultivated spot, in maize, which the invalids and convalescents were wont to tend.</p>
<p>"Here Marion made his fortress. Having secured all the boats of the neighborhood, he chose such as he needed, and destroyed the rest. Where the natural defenses of the island seemed to require <a id="Page_258" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[258]"></a> aid from art, he bestowed it; and, by cutting away bridges and obstructing the ordinary pathways with timber, he contrived to insulate, as much as possible, the country under his command.</p>
<p>"From this fortress his scouting parties were sent forth nightly in all directions. Enemies were always easy to be found. The British maintained minor posts at Nelson's Ferry and Scott's Lake, as well as Georgetown; and the Tories on Lynch's Creek and Little Pedee were much more numerous, if less skilfully conducted, than the men of Marion.</p>
<p>"Marion's encampment implied no repose, no forbearance of the active business of war. Very far from it. He was never more dangerous to an enemy than when he seemed quiet in camp.</p>
<p>"His camp, indeed, was frequently a lure, by which to tempt the Tories into unseasonable exposure. The post at Snow's Island gave him particular facilities for this species of warfare. He had but to <a id="Page_259" class="x-epubmaker-pageno" title="[259]"></a> cross a river, and a three hours' march enabled him to forage in an enemy's country.</p>
<p>"Reinforcements came to him daily, and it was only now, for the first time, that his command began to assume the appearance, and exhibit the force of a brigade."</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>Bonnie Prince Charlie</b>: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service. The boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and serves with the French army at Dettingen. He kills his father's foe in a duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland.</p>
<p class="s08">"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.' The lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness of treatment and variety of incident Mr. Henty has surpassed himself."—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>With Clive in India</b>; or, the Beginnings of an Empire. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme. At its commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the native princes. At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the greater part of Southern India. The author has given a full and accurate account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike interest to the volume.</p>
<p class="s08">"He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story which of itself is deeply interesting. Young people assuredly will be delighted with the volume."—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>The Lion of the North</b>: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of Religion. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">John Schönberg</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In this story Mr. Henty gives the history of the first part of the Thirty Years' War. The issue had its importance, which has extended to the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany. The army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen, and among these was the hero of the story.</p>
<p class="s08">"The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to be profited."—<i>Times.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>The Dragon and the Raven</b>; or, The Days of King Alfred. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">C. J. Staniland</span>, R.I. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of the sea-wolves. The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the battles fought by King Alfred. He is driven from his home, takes to the sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris.</p>
<p class="s08">"Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish reader."—<i>Athenæum</i>.</p>
<p class="hanging"><b>The Young Carthaginian</b>: A Story of the Times of Hannibal. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">C. J. Staniland</span>, R.I. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen appreciation of the merits of the contest. That it was at first a struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge. To let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the world Mr. Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history, but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the reader.</p>
<p class="s08">"Well constructed and vividly told. From first to last nothing stays the interest of the narrative. It bears us along as on a stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its force."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>In Freedom's Cause</b>: A Story of Wallace and Bruce. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War of Independence. The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages. The researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing man—and a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is full of "hairbreadth 'scapes" and wild adventure.</p>
<p class="s08">"It is written in the author's best style. Full of the wildest and most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one side."—<i>The Schoolmaster.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>With Lee in Virginia</b>: A Story of the American Civil War. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of the struggle. He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties.</p>
<p class="s08">"One of the best stories for lads which Mr. Henty has yet written. The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal interest and charm of the story."—<i>Standard.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>By England's Aid</b>; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604). By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Alfred Pearse</span>, and Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service of one of "the fighting Veres." After many adventures by sea and land, one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the Corsairs. He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture of Cadiz.</p>
<p class="s08">"It is an admirable book for youngsters. It overflows with stirring incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of the scene are finely reproduced. The illustrations add to its attractiveness."—<i>Boston Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>By Right of Conquest</b>; or, With Cortez in Mexico. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">W. S. Stacey</span>, and Two Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.50.</p>
<p>The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most romantic and daring exploits in history. With this as the groundwork of his story Mr. Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth, Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the Spaniards in the New World. He is beset by many perils among the natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the devotion of an Aztec princess. At last by a ruse he obtains the protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride.</p>
<p class="s08">"'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly successful historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet published."—<i>Academy.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>In the Reign of Terror</b>: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">J. Schönberg</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to Paris at the crisis of the Revolution. Imprisonment and death reduce their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three young daughters of the house in his charge. After hairbreadth escapes they reach Nantes. There the girls are condemned to death in the coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy protector.</p>
<p class="s08">"Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat Mr. Henty's record. His adventures will delight boys by the audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr. Henty's best."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>With Wolfe in Canada</b>; or, The Winning of a Continent. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In the present volume Mr. Henty gives an account of the struggle between Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent. On the issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves. The fall of Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe.</p>
<p class="s08">"It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."—<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>True to the Old Flag</b>: A Tale of the American War of Independence. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with greater courage and good conduct. The historical portion of the book being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven with the general narrative and carried through the book.</p>
<p class="s08">"Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American emancipation. The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook."—<i>The Times.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>The Lion of St. Mark</b>: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to the severest tests. The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and bloodshed. He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of one of the chief men of Venice.</p>
<p class="s08">"Every boy should read 'The Lion of St. Mark.' Mr. Henry has never produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more vivacious."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>A Final Reckoning</b>: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">W. B. Wollen</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood emigrates to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police. A few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.</p>
<p class="s08">"Mr. Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully constructed, or a better written story than this."—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Under Drake's Flag</b>: A Tale of the Spanish Main. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy of the sea. The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation. The historical portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages.</p>
<p class="s08">"A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough, one would think, to turn his hair gray."—<i>Harper's Monthly Magazine.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>By Sheer Pluck</b>: A Tale of the Ashanti War. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness. His hero, after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.</p>
<p class="s08">"Mr. Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories. 'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>By Pike and Dyke</b>: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Maynard Brown</span>, and 4 Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>In this story Mr. Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age—William the Silent. Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes through the great sieges of the time. He ultimately settles down as Sir Edward Martin.</p>
<p class="s08">"Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be students in spite of themselves."—<i>St. James' Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>St. George for England</b>: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than that of the reign of Edward III. Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising; these are treated by the author in "St. George for England." The hero of the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice, but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.</p>
<p class="s08">"Mr. Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."—<i>The Standard.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Captain's Kidd's Gold</b>: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy. By <span class="smcap">James Franklin Fitts</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of buried treasure. A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming eyes—sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner, of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft. There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated than Capt. Kidd. Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr. Fitts' true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious way. The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried there by two of Kidd's crew. The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.</p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Captain Bayley's Heir</b>: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">H. M. Paget</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a considerable property. The former falls into a trap laid by the latter, and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for America. He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.</p>
<p class="s08">"Mr. Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have excelled."—<i>Christian Leader.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>For Name and Fame</b>; or, Through Afghan Passes. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Gordon Browne</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan. The hero, after being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding to join the army at the Afghan passes. He accompanies the force under General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan.</p>
<p class="s08">"The best feature of the book—apart from the interest of its scenes of adventure—is its honest effort to do justice to the patriotism of the Afghan people."—<i>Daily News.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Captured by Apes</b>: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal Trainer. By <span class="smcap">Harry Prentice</span>. 12mo, cloth, $1.00.</p>
<p>The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago. Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities. The vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured by the apes that overrun the place. The lad discovers that the ruling spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with whose instruction he had been especially diligent. The brute recognizes him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey recollection. Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man escapes death.

<p>There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough. This is largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and successes of Marlborough. His career as general extended over little more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare which has never been surpassed.</p>
<p class="s08">"Mr. Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work—to enforce the doctrine of courage and truth. Lads will read 'The Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are quite sure."—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="s08">"The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures. It is admirably illustrated."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>With Washington at Monmouth</b>: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys. By <span class="smcap">James Otis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch Ball, "son of that Mrs. Ball whose dancing school was situated on Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as the principal characters. The story is laid during the winter when Lord Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from Valley Forge. One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger. The story abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has not been hastily done, or without considerable study.</p>

<p>Mr. Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and attractive story. The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his Galilean home with the favor of Titus.</p>

<p>A "down-east" plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from love of adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can gain a livelihood. While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the brig in order to gain the insurance. Once it is known he is in possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island, explaining to the crew that the boy is afflicted with leprosy. While thus involuntarily playing the part of a Crusoe, Ned discovers a wreck submerged in the sand, and overhauling the timbers for the purpose of gathering material with which to build a hut finds a considerable amount of treasure. Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to make as entertaining a story of sea life as the most captious boy could desire.</p>

<p>This tale smacks of the salt sea. It is just the kind of story that the majority of boys yearn for. From the moment that the Sea Queen dispenses with the services of the tug in lower New York bay till the breeze leaves her becalmed off the coast of Florida, one can almost hear the whistle of the wind through her rigging, the creak of her straining cordage as she heels to the leeward, and feel her rise to the snow-capped waves which her sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam. Off Marquesas Keys she floats in a dead calm. Ben Clark, the hero of the story, and Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface of the water. They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog cuts them off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin. They take refuge on board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they are cast ashore upon a low sandy key. Their adventures from this point cannot fail to charm the reader. As a writer for young people Mr. Otis is a prime favorite. His style is captivating, and never for a moment does he allow the interest to flag. In "The Castaways" he is at his best.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>The Young Scout</b>; The Story of a West Point Lieutenant. By <span class="smcap">Edward S. Ellis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The crafty Apache chief Geronimo but a few years ago was the most terrible scourge of the southwest border. The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the incidents of Geronimo's last raid. The hero is Lieutenant James Decker, a recent graduate of West Point. Ambitious to distinguish himself so as to win well-deserved promotion, the young man takes many a desperate chance against the enemy and on more than one occasion narrowly escapes with his life. The story naturally abounds in thrilling situations, and being historically correct, it is reasonable to believe it will find great favor with the boys. In our opinion Mr. Ellis is the best writer of Indian stories now before the public.</p>

While O'Rooney and the lads are absent inspecting the neighborhood O'Rooney has an exciting experience and young Brandon becomes separated from his party. He is captured by hostile Indians, but is rescued by an Indian whom the lads had assisted. This is a very entertaining narrative of Southern California in the days immediately preceding the construction of the Pacific railroads. Mr. Ellis seems to be particularly happy in this line of fiction, and the present story is fully as entertaining as anything he has ever written.</p>

<p>Boys who like an admixture of sport and adventure will find this book just to their taste.

After that they have a lively time with alligators and divers varieties of the finny tribe. Andrew gets into trouble with a band of Seminole Indians and gets away without having his scalp raised.

That Mr. Rathborne knows just how to interest the boys is apparent at a glance, and lads who are in search of a rare treat will do well to read this entertaining story.</p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Guy Harris</b>: The Runaway. By <span class="smcap">Harry Castlemon</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Guy Harris lived in a small city on the shore of one of the Great Lakes. His head became filled with quixotic notions of going West to hunt grizzlies, in fact, Indians. He is persuaded to go to sea, and gets a glimpse of the rough side of life in a sailor's boarding house. He ships on a vessel and for five months leads a hard life. He deserts his ship at San Francisco and starts out to become a backwoodsman, but rough experiences soon cure him of all desire to be a hunter. At St. Louis he becomes a clerk and for a time he yields to the temptations of a great city. The book will not only interest boys generally on account of its graphic style, but will put many facts before their eyes in a new light. This is one of Castlemon's most attractive stories.</p>
<p class="hanging"><b>The Train Boy.</b> By <span class="smcap">Horatio Alger, Jr.</span> 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Paul Palmer was a wide-awake boy of sixteen who supported his mother and sister by selling books and papers on one of the trains running between Chicago and Milwaukee. He detects a young man named Luke Denton in the act of picking the pocket of a young lady, and also incurs the enmity of his brother Stephen, a worthless fellow. Luke and Stephen plot to ruin Paul, but their plans are frustrated.

<p class="hanging"><b>Joe's Luck</b>: A Boy's Adventures in California. By <span class="smcap">Horatio Alger, Jr.</span> 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Without a doubt Joe Mason was a lucky boy, but he deserved the golden chances that fell to his lot, for he had the pluck and ambition to push himself to the front. Joe had but one dollar in the world when he stood despondently on the California Mail Steamship Co.'s dock in New York watching the preparations incident to the departure of the steamer. The same dollar was still Joe's entire capital when he landed in the bustling town of tents and one-story cabins—the San Francisco of '51, and inside of the week the boy was proprietor of a small restaurant earning a comfortable profit. The story is chock full of stirring incidents, while the amusing situations are furnished by Joshua Bickford, from Pumpkin Hollow, and the fellow who modestly styles himself the "Rip-tail Roarer, from Pike Co., Missouri." Mr. Alger never writes a poor book, and "Joe's Luck" is certainly one of his best.</p>

<p>By a sudden turn of fortune's wheel the three heroines of this story are brought down from a household of lavish comfort to meet the incessant cares and worries of those who have to eke out a very limited income. And the charm of the story lies in the cheery helpfulness of spirit developed in the girls by their changed circumstances; while the author finds a pleasant ending to all their happy makeshifts.</p>
<p class="s08">"The story is charmingly told, and the book can be warmly recommended as a present for girls."—<i>Standard.</i></p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Giannetta</b>: A Girl's Story of Herself. By <span class="smcap">Rosa Mulholland</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Lockhart Bogle</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>The daughter of a gentleman, who had married a poor Swiss girl, was stolen as an infant by some of her mother's relatives. The child having died, they afterward for the sake of gain substitute another child for it, and the changeling, after becoming a clever modeler of clay images, is suddenly transferred to the position of a rich heiress. She develops into a good and accomplished woman, and though the imposture of her early friends is finally discovered, she has gained too much love and devotion to be really a sufferer by the surrender of her estates.</p>
<p class="s08">"Extremely well told and full of interest. Giannetta is a true heroine—warm-hearted, self-sacrificing, and, as all good women nowadays are, largely touched with enthusiasm of humanity. The illustrations are unusually good. One of the most attractive gift books of the season."—<i>The Academy.</i></p>

There is a subtle attraction about the book which will make it a great favorite with thoughtful girls.</p>
<p class="s08">"Another book for girls we can warmly commend. There is a delightful piquancy in the experiences and trials of a young English girl who studies painting in Paris."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>A story which has in it so strong a dramatic element that it will attract readers of all ages and of either sex. The incidents of the plot, arising from the thoughtless indulgence of a deceptive freak, are exceedingly natural, and the keen interest of the narrative is sustained from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="s08">"Sarah Doudney has no superior as a writer of high-toned stories—pure in style, original in conception, and with skillfully wrought out plots; but we have seen nothing equal in dramatic energy to this book."—<i>Christian Leader.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Molesworth's children are finished studies. She is never sentimental, but writes common sense in a straightforward manner. A joyous earnest spirit pervades her work, and her sympathy is unbounded. She loves them with her whole heart, while she lays bare their little minds, and expresses their foibles, their faults, their virtues, their inward struggles, their conception of duty, and their instinctive knowledge of the right and wrong of things. She knows their characters, she understands their wants, and she desires to help them.</p>
<p class="hanging"><b>Polly</b>: A New Fashioned Girl. By <span class="smcap">L. T. Meade</span>. Illustrated 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>
<p>Few authors have achieved a popularity equal to Mrs. Meade as a writer of stories for young girls. Her characters are living beings of flesh and blood, not lay figures of conventional type. Into the trials and crosses, and everyday experiences, the reader enters at once with zest and hearty sympathy. While Mrs. Meade always writes with a high moral purpose, her lessons of life, purity and nobility of character are rather inculcated by example than intruded as sermons.</p>

<p class="s08">"It seems to me not at all easier to draw a lifelike child than to draw a lifelike man or woman: Shakespeare and Webster were the only two men of their age who could do it with perfect delicacy and success. Our own age is more fortunate, on this single score at least, having a larger and far nobler proportion of female writers; among whom, since the death of George Eliot, there is none left whose touch is so exquisite and masterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to knowledge, whose bright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so delightful as Mrs. Molesworth."—<span class="smcap">A.
