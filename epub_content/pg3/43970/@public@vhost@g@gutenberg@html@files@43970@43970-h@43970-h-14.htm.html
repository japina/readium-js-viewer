Sentence against the Woman, for special Reasons, we hear, is respited for the present."â€”<cite>Boston Evening-Post</cite>, Oct. 7, 1754.</p>
<p>At the Superior Court held in Cambridge last week, one Hannah Dudley of Lincoln was convicted of repeatedly commiting Adultery and Fornication with her own Mother's husband, an old Man of 76 years of age. She was sentenced to be set upon the Gallows for the space of one Hour, with a Rope about her Neck, and the other end cast over the Gallows, and in the way from thence to the Common Goal, that she be severely whipped 30 stripes, and that she for ever after wear a Capital I of two inches long and proportionable bigness cut out in Cloth of a different Colour to her Cloaths, and sewed upon her upper Garment on the outside of her arm, or on her Back, in Open View. [No further mention is made of the step-father.]â€”<cite>Boston News-Letter</cite>, Aug. 16, 1759.</p>

be<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.Â  There are a few<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.Â  See<br/>paragraph 1.C below.Â  There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>works.Â  See paragraph 1.E below.<br/><br/>1.C.Â  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.Â  Nearly all the individual works in the<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.Â  If an<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br/>are removed.Â  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br/>the work.Â  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D.Â  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work.Â  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br/>a constant state of change.Â  If you are outside the United States, check<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.Â  The Foundation makes

the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees<br/>or charges.Â  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or<br/>1.E.9.<br/><br/>1.E.3.Â  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution<br/>must comply with both
